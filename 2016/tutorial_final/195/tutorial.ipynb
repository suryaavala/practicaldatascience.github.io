    "This tutorial will introduce you to how to use a machine learning platform called GraphLab. We will mainly focus on the graph analytics module of GraphLab, since efficient graph computation was one of the initial purposes of this project (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2212354). The GraphLab project was first started by Prof. Carlos Guestrin in 2009 when he was still in Carnegie Mellon University. It showed very good performance in many data mining tasks. \n",

The simplest way to find the diameter of a graph is find the shortest path between any pair of vertices. Then the largest distance of any of the paths is the diameter of the graph. We can utilize the shortest_path function we wrote before to help solve this problem. The following cell shows an example of how to use shortest path results to compute diameter of a graph."
