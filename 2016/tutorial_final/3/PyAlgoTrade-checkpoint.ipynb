    "Introduction\n",
    "    PyAlgoTrade is a Python Algorithmic Trading Library mainly used to backtest any user devised strategy. It also provides support for paper trading and live trading. Quantitative estimation of the accuracy of new trading algorithms on historical market data is the prime use of PyAlgoTrade. In this tutorial we will learn how to use pyalgotrade, create a simple user strategy, understand the features using a simple strategy and explore features to backtest and analyse the same strategy.\n",

    "1. Event driven.\n",
    "2. Supports Market, Limit, Stop and StopLimit orders. These are essentially when we would sell and buy.\n",
    "3. Supports Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance and NinjaTrader CSV files. These are the market feed data.\n",
    "4. Bitcoin trading support through Bitstamp.\n",
    "5. Technical indicators and filters like SMA, WMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Hurst exponent and others.\n",
    "6. Performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, trade and drawdown analysis.\n",
    "7. Handling Twitter events in realtime.\n",
    "8. Event profiler.\n",

    "PyAlgoTrade has 6 main components:\n",

    "Strategies\n",
    "These are classes which contain the business logic of the trading algorithm: buying time, selling time etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Feeds\n",
    "These are data providing abstractions. It can be a CSV feed that loads bars to a strategy or a Twitter feed that allows incorporating Twitter events into trading decisions. This data is the one on which the business logic is written.\n",

    "These are a set of classes that allow you to distribute backtesting among different computers, or different processes running in the same computer, or a combination of both. They make horizontal scaling easy."

    "Different investors use moving averages for different reasons. Some use them as their primary analytical tool, while others simply use them as a confidence builder to back up their investment decisions. A crossover is the most basic type of signal and is favored among many traders because it removes all emotion. The most basic type of crossover is when the price of an asset moves from one side of a moving average and closes on the other. Price crossovers are used by traders to identify shifts in momentum and can be used as a basic entry or exit strategy.\n",
