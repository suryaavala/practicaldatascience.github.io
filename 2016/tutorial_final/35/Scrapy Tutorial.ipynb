Meandering west towards Bristol Bay and the Bering Sea, the Alagnak traverses the beautiful Alaska Peninsula, providing an unparalleled opportunity to experience the unique wilderness, wildlife, and cultural heritage of southwest Alaska.\\n', u'\\nAlaska\\u2019s parks, forests and refuges are rich and varied. The Anchorage Interagency Visitor Center helps visitors and residents to have meaningful, safe, enjoyable experiences on public lands, and encourages them to sustain the natural and cultural resources of Alaska. This center and three others statewide provide trip-planning, interpretation, and education for all ages.\\n', u'\\nDuring World War II the remote Aleutian Islands, home to the Unangan (Aleut) people for over 8,000 years, became a fiercely contested battleground in the Pacific. This thousand-mile-long archipelago saw invasion by Japanese forces, the occupation of two islands; a mass relocation of Unangax civilians; a 15-month air war; and one of the deadliest battles in the Pacific Theater.\\n', u'\\nGiven its remote location and challenging weather conditions, Aniakchak is one of the most wild and least visited in places in the National Park System. This landscape is a vibrant reminder of Alaska\\'s location in the volcanically active \"Ring of Fire\" as it is home to an impressive six mile (10 km) wide, 2,500 ft (762 m) deep caldera formed during a massive volcanic eruption 3,500 years ago.\\n', u'\\nImagine a place of whimsical beauty and larger-than-life landscapes: an ancestral home to ice-age giants and turbulent volcanic activity. A land that holds secrets to the intriguing history of human migration, sustains people that have lived here before its establishment as a preserve and continues to be part of a wide breadth of? traditions. Bering Land Bridge is unlike any other place on earth.\\n', u'\\nNorth of the Arctic Circle, the monument forms 70 miles of shoreline on the Chukchi Sea.  More than 114 beach ridges provide evidence of human use for 5,000 years.  The Inupiat continue to use the area today.  Vast wetlands provide habitat for shorebirds from as far away as South America.  Hikers and boaters can see carpets of wildflowers among shrubs containing wisps of qiviut from muskoxen.\\n', u\"\\nDenali is six million acres of wild land, bisected by one ribbon of road. Travelers along it see the relatively low-elevation taiga forest give way to high alpine tundra and snowy mountains, culminating in North America's tallest peak, 20,310' Denali. Wild animals large and small roam un-fenced lands, living as they have for ages. Solitude, tranquility and wilderness await.\\n\", u'\\nThis vast landscape does not contain any roads or trails. Visitors discover intact ecosystems where people have lived with the land for thousands of years. Wild rivers meander through glacier-carved valleys, caribou migrate along age-old trails, endless summer light fades into aurora-lit night skies of winter. It remains virtually unchanged except by the forces of nature.\\n', u\"\\nCovering 3.3 million acres of rugged mountains, dynamic glaciers, temperate rainforest, wild coastlines and deep sheltered fjords, Glacier Bay National Park is a highlight of Alaska's Inside Passage and part of a 25-million acre World Heritage Site\\u2014one of the world\\u2019s largest international protected areas. From sea to summit, Glacier Bay offers limitless opportunities for adventure and inspiration.\\n\", u'\\nOn the rooftop of the world, the I\\xf1upiat Heritage Center in Barrow, Alaska, tells the story of the I\\xf1upiat people. They have thrived for thousands of years in one of the harshest climates on Earth, hunting the bowhead, or \"Agviq.\" In the 19th century, these lonely seas swarmed with commercial whalemen from New England, who also sought the bowhead for its valuable baleen and blubber.\\n', u'\\nKatmai National Monument was established in 1918 to protect the volcanically devastated region surrounding Mount Katmai and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. Today, Katmai National Park and Preserve remains an active volcanic landscape, but it also protects 9,000 years of human history as well as important habitat for salmon and thousands of brown bears.\\n', u\"\\nAt the edge of the Kenai Peninsula lies a land where the ice age lingers. Nearly 40 glaciers flow from the Harding Icefield, Kenai Fjords' crowning feature. Wildlife thrives in icy waters and lush forests around this vast expanse of ice. Native Alutiiq relied on these resources to nurture a life entwined with the sea. Today, shrinking glaciers bear witness to the effects of our changing climate.\\n\", u'\\n\\u201cGold!\\u201d is what the headlines read in 1897, starting the Klondike Gold Rush. Thousands, hoping to ease the woes of economic depression, sold farms, dropped businesses and boarded ships to follow their dreams north. Today, the park commemorates the bravery of the stampeders who ventured north by protecting the trails, historic boomtowns and buildings of the Klondike Gold Rush era.\\n', u'\\nCaribou, sand dunes, the Kobuk River, Onion Portage - just some of the facets of Kobuk Valley National Park. Half a million caribou migrate through, their tracks crisscrossing sculpted dunes. The Kobuk River is an ancient and current path for people and wildlife. For 9000 years, people came to Onion Portage to harvest caribou as they swam the river. Even today, that rich tradition continues.\\n', u'\\nLake Clark National Park is a land of stunning beauty where volcanoes steam, salmon run, bears forage, craggy mountains reflect in shimmering turquoise lakes, and local people and culture still depend on the land and water of their home.  Solitude is found around every bend in the river and shoulder of a mountain.  Venture into the park to become part of the wilderness.\\n', u\"\\nAs one of North America's largest mountain-ringed river basins with an intact ecosystem, the Noatak River environs features some of the Arctic's finest arrays of plants and animals. The river is classified as a national wild and scenic river, and offers stunning wilderness float-trip opportunities - from deep in the Brooks Range to the tidewater of the Chukchi Sea.\\n\", u'\\nOn an island amid towering spruce and hemlock, Sitka National Historical Park preserves the site of a battle between invading Russian traders and indigenous Kiks.\\xe1di Tlingit. Park visitors are awed by Tlingit and Haida totem poles standing along the park\\u2019s scenic coastal trail, and the restored Russian Bishop\\u2019s House speaks of Russia\\u2019s little known colonial legacy in North America.\\n', u'\\nAt World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, home of the USS Arizona Memorial, learn about one of the most pivotal moments in US history: the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the subsequent entry of the United States into World War II. The monument preserves and interprets the stories of the Pacific War, from the internment of Japanese Americans to the battles in the Aleutians.\\n', u'\\nWrangell St. Elias is a vast national park that rises from the ocean all the way up to 18,008 ft. Mount St. Elias. At 13.2 million acres, it\\u2019s the same size as Yellowstone Nat. Park, Yosemite Nat. Park, and Switzerland combined! Within this wild landscape, people continue to live off the land as they have done for centuries. This is a rugged, beautiful area filled with opportunities for adventure.\\n', u\"\\nLocated in Interior Alaska, Yukon-Charley Rivers offers exploration in a largely untouched landscape. Whether you float the mighty Yukon River or paddle the Charley River's whitewater, your memories will last a lifetime. Geology, cultural history, gold rush remnants, wildlife, and vast scenery will be a part of your experience. But, the strongest element will be solitude.

    "In the following example, we are going to send our spider to Yelp to find which restaurants are popular in Pittsburgh. We simply ask the spider to work on the page which holds the information of those popular restaurants with rank from high to low. We will extract the names, average ratings and review counts of listed restaurants. Obviously, one page is not enough to hold so many great popular restaurants in Pittsbugh, what can we do to find them all? No worry, we can take advantage of the \"next\" anchor in the end of each page. Let's see how spider find there next destination through example below. **It is worth noting that when you crawl some websites, you may encounter a problem related to robot settings, to solve this, simply make some slight modification in project directory (in this case `demo/demo/settings.py`) by setting ROBOTSTXT_OBEY = False from default True. Please also note these process could take at most 3 minutes since there are so many next pages.**"
