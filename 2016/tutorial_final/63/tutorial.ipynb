    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you're going to get started with xml raw data parsing, storing, and querying based on DBLP publication metadata(will be attached in the handout) to analyse coauthorship and other kinds of relationships between scientists and authors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cause the adventure we would most likely to discover is about relationships, using structured database like MySQL is fine, but as for the search, the entity's relationships between each other is complicated when dealing with multi-level relationships, cause we need to join so many tables together to perform the search, so to make the search faster and cheaper, we introduce the Graph Database here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph database is not like the relational database, it's suitable for big data analysis as the schemaless design, it no longer focus on the data itself, while the connections between them. Data relationships drive today's intelligent applications, and the Graph Database is exactly you need to harnesses those connections for sustainable competitive advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with graph database, we use __Neo4j__, it has strengths in powerful data models just as general as RDBMS, and suitable for agile development also fast for query connected data. Supported with the query functions for the graph database, we use __Cypher__ here, it is a pattern-matching query language for graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring for this section: 5pts for parsing xml data, 10pts for storing metadata into Neo4j, 50pts for query the database based on 5 different queries. "
