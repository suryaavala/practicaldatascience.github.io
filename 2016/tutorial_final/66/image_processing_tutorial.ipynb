    "## Introduction\n",
    "[Image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing) and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) have long been popular topics in both academic and industrial fields. While image processing is mainly focusing on processing raw images without giving any knowledge feedback on them, computer vision tries to do what a human brain does with the retinal data, that means understanding the scene based on image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to some basic methods for image manipulation and processing. Image data forms a key aspect of data science. Image data can be the initial input (as raw materials) for the whole data analysis pipeline and is also very important from the perspective of data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we want to preprocess our images, i.e. converting a color image into an image composed solely of gray scale tones, making the edges in an image more clear so that people can be better at distinguishing the foreground (the target) from the background, cropping multiple images into the same size for further analysis, rotating or flipping the images for better displaying purpose, drawing contour lines to show certain properties of the content in the image in some special cases, or making certain part of an image be blur to display a better contrast between the foreground and the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these scenarios described above are involved with the basic methods for image manipulation and processing we are going to explore in this tutorial. In the end, we list out extra resources for readers to go further into methods involved with high-level image processing and computer vision. "

    "\n",
    "The main tools we are going to use in this tutorial are numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PIL and scikit-image. \n",
    "\n",
    "[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is an extension to Python, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) is another open source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. It can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/), known as the Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to the Python interpreter. The library supports many file formats,, and provides powerful image processing and graphics capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "[scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/)(formerly scikits.image) is an open source image processing and computer vision library for the Python programming language. It includes algorithms for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation, analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more. It is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy."

    "Intuitively, image denoising is the process of removing noise from images and preserving the edges. Oftentimes, we use filters to achieve this. A filter is a device or process that removes some unwanted components or features from a signal. As an image can be viewed as a type of high dimensional signal, we can use filters to alleviate the noise in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we apply [Gaussian filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) and [median filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter) to the image. You can learn about more types of filters [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing))"

For more advanced image processing and computer vision methods, we may use [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/), [Mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/)(an interactive 3D plotting package) and refer to the following resources.\n",
