    "Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. If the other player makes enough (maybe 5) incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example game of Hangman in progress. The underlined letters appear in the word in their correct places, while the crossed-out letters do not appear, and each crossed-out letter corresponds to one part of the drawing. In this case, the secret word is \"hangman\".\n",

    "\n",
    "In its purest form, hangman is a word game played between two people. One person selects a secret word, and the other tries to determine the word by guessing it letter-by-letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a young person, when you first started to play the game, you probably called out random letters. Once you got a hit of a couple of letters, it helped you narrow down the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "After playing a number of games, you probably graduated to learning that not all letters are used equally. It's rare that the letter ‘Q' appears in a word, whereas ‘T' is used a lot more often. And also, once you get just a couple of letters of in a hangman puzzle, the game becomes easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "These hints give us insights to design an AI model for hangman. The order to guess letters has certain strategies to get better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "PS: we expect the target word to be in our dictionary, and we use this dictionary to design strategy.\n",
