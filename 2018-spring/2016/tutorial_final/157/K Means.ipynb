    "# K-Means Clustering \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "K-Means Clustering is an algorithm that is used to partition a set of data. The algorithm splits the data into k different groups, where k is specified by the user. The final result from the clustering results in k different groups that have split up all n points to belong to one of the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlight of the Algorithm\n",
    "The main algorithm involves inputting a data set and the number of groups ($k$) that the data will be split up into. We start off with intializing $k$ different means randomly. This can be done by either picking points on the graph randomly or randomly picking k points from the data set. After initializing our means, we will go through each point in the data set and assign it to the mean that is closest to. After assigning each point to a mean, we will then iterate through each mean and collect all of the data points that we said belonged to that mean value group. Using this collection, we can calculate the new mean by finding the average of all the points associated to that group. We repeat the process of calculating the new mean for all of the k means. After computing the new means, we can check to see if they are the same as before, if not then we run the whole algorithm starting from the data point assignment to each mean and continue until the means do not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, it may take too long to ensure that all means are unchanged; thus, you can limit the run time of the algorithm by changing certain parameters to stop running. We can do this by defining a certain number of iterations, after which, the algorithm will stop running. We can also play with recomputation of means (explained more later).\n",
    "The following picture shows a good representation of how the K Means Clustering Algorithm works for 2 iterations. The points A1-A8 are all the data points from the data set, while the red \"X\" represents the mean for that algorithm. Since there are only 3 red \"X\"s there are only 3 groups that the data can be split into, so $k = 3$ in this situation. \n",
    "![title](k-means-4.gif)\n",
    "From the picture above, we can see that the assignment of groups on the data points to each mean changed after one main iteration. Initially, A4 was a part of the cluster to the top, but after recomputing the mean, it became clustered with the mean to the right. It is not uncommon for points to change categories each iteration since the means move around until they have found a stable spot. In addition, notice how the means (the red X's) have changed from the previous iteration to the next. Recall that this occurs from the recomputing means step in the algorithm. Thus, the means keep changing every iteration until we have found a stable spot for them.\n"

    "Python in fact has its own built-in functions from the scikit library for K-Means. It would be easier to use these functions if you would like a quick implementation of K-Means. You can read more about it here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html\n",

    "Recall that the above implementation focuses on using K-Means on a 2D plane. However, the algorithm can be used on all kinds of data sets depending on how you represent the data and the distance technique you would like to use. For example, if you would like to use K-Means clustering on categorical data, you can use the K-modes algorithm. You can find further information on K-Modes here: https://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0603/0603120.pdf\n"
