    "## Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial will give you a taste of a randomized algorithm family called reservoir sampling. This is an algorithm that is commonly used to pick a set number of items from a dataset of unknown size. Before we jump into the algorithm itself, let's look at a sample simple scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Scenario\n",
    "Imagine you have a pool of 100 people (N = 100). You want to randomly select 20 of them to come with you on a weekend trip to Frank Llyod Wright's Falling Water (k = 20). The simple and intuitive way to do this to generate k random numbers between 0 and N-1, get the name at every corresponding index, and then invite those people and enjoy your trip. Note: each index must be unique - you can't clone a person and take them on the trip. Let's quickly take a look at how this would work, assuming N is small (10000 will do for this quick example)."

    "Again, imagine you have a pool of people. You want to randomly select k of them to come with you on a weekend trip to Frank Llyod Wright's Falling Water (k = 20). However, now you have absolutely no idea how large your pool of friends is (N). N could equal 4 or it could equal 999,000,000,000. The naive soultion would be to iterate through the given list (of the pool of people) to calculate N and then do as we did above (i.e. generate k random numbers between 0 and N-1, get the name at every corresponding, unique index, and so on. Let's see how this would pan out on the list we used above. Let's assume for the sake of this problem that python's len() function cannot be employed. "

    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "Observe that the latter code we ran where we calculated the length (N) of our list is orders of magnitude slower than our former code where N was provided to us. We need not run through the array twice in the tweaked problem. There has to be a faster way of generating k random samples from an unknown sized pool or reservoir. Cue the algorithm!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Reservoir sampling allows us to solve this tweaked problem in a quick and efficient manner, O(n) time as opposed to O(n^2) from the double pass seen above. It seems intuitive to want to iterate through the pool (also known as stream) to create our reservoir of size k. More often than not, this alogrithm is used when the stream we are sampling from is too large to store in memory and it would be grossly inefficient to iterate through the unknown sized list that could have millions and millions of data points - we will discuss practical uses in a bit. But first, how do we implement this algorithm in O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To start, we will fill a reservoir of the first k samples from our pool (also known as stream).\n",
    "2. Next, we want to iterate through the list once, from k+1 to the len(N).\n",
    "3. During this iteration, we will generate a random integer - if that integer is less than k, then we will replace the element at the integer index found with the current element of our iteration. \n"

    "### The Why\n",
    "When we originally pick our k elements from the stream to put into the reservoir, each element is picked with a probability of k/n. We pick our n+1 element with a probability of k/(n+1) and the elements currently in our list have a 1/k probability of eviction. The probability we replace an element is (k/(n+1))*(1/k) = 1/(n+1), which means that the probabilty we don't replace an element is n/(n+1). In order for an element to be in the n+1 set, it has to be chosen and evict an existing element (probability of k/(n+1)) or it has to have been in the original n set and not chosen to be replace ((k/n)*(n/(n+1)) = k/(n+1))!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weighted Reservoir Sampling\n",
    "Let's imagine a similar scenario except we have a corresponding list of weights associated with each item in the list. We prefer certain items to be in our reservoir over others. We adjust the algorithm to be as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To start, we will fill a reservoir of the first k samples from our pool (also known as stream), again. This time though. We will sum their weights as we go. When we add a new weight in, we divide by k to ensure proportionality.\n",
    "2. Next, we want to iterate through the list once, from k+1 to the len(N).\n",
    "3. We will add the weight of the current element to the sum. The probability of replacement will be this current item's weight over the sum.\n",
    "3. Then we will replace the element at a randomly picked index between 0 and k index with the current element of our iteration if and only if a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 is less than or equal to the probability we calculated earlier!"

    "### An Aside\n",
    "<b>Distributed Random Sampling</b> is a popular technique used to perform reservoir sampling across several machines. Sometimes our stream of data is too large to be stored in memory and would take too long to process on one machine. At that point, we can decide to distribute the data amongst m machines, each of which does its own weighted sampling of k elements as described above. We amalgamate the k samples from each, and then regenerate keys on one machine to pick the final k elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, reservoir sampling comes most in handy when an entire data stream does not fit in memory. Imagine if our stream was every Google search performed in the month of June every year since Google's inception or every transaction made on Amazon in the past three holiday seasons - these streams are extremely large. In order to randomly select a k number of them we would need to probably employ distributed random sampling, as these streams would a) be too large to efficiently iterate over to get its size and b) may not fit into memory - or would significantly slow down our machine if we tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Twitter Example\n",
    "In our past homeworks, we have manipulated Twitter data. Let's do a real life example where we load and select k tweets from an unknown stream of tweets to presumably do data analysis on. "
