    "For easy to use, Bokeh classifies their interfaces into three levels. In this tutorial, I would like to introduce them in the following order which I believe is matched to its hardness, from easy to difficult.\n",
    "- bokeh.plotting: an intermediate-level interface to draw plots like line, circle\n",
    "- bokeh.charts: a high-level interface to build statistical charts such as scatter, histogram, and whisker\n",

    "It is obviously that 2500 tweets cannot represent 0.3 billion people in the USA. In order to make more accurate analysis, we need a bigger data set. But, twitter has [rate limitation](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting) to prevent you consume away their api resources. So, you can add intervals (sleep) between your requests. Besides, twitter api only provides latest tweets within one week. You could turn to third party storage for twitter historical data. \n",
    "- language context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is interesting and formidable. Does a tweet which contains \"votetrump\" mean the sender support trump? What if the tweet is \"only jerk would #votetrump\"? Thus, advanced text analysis technique could be used in such case to analyze the standpoint of the speaker. This part would not include in this library tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- data missing:\n",
    "\n",
    "As the comments on the code, we choose last two alphabets of \"user_location\" attribute in the user profile as geo-information of the tweet. Actually, user_location is filled by user and it can be any word related or unrelated to geo-location, such as 'Winterfell' (place in a popular TV show) or 'Pittsburgh, PA'. The coordinates (latitude and longitude of the tweet sending position) or place attributes of tweets are more accurate than user_location. But most of these attributes are 'None' due to user privacy protection. So, let's use user_location as an example for this Bokeh library toturial. This tutorial is not focus on data processing and data analytics.\n"
