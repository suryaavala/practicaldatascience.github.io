    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thoughout the course, we've seen how data storage or data processing mechanisms can be deduced into an operational process of graphs. Particularly, we've learnt a few graph analysing algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, PageRank algorithm and Girvan-Newman algorithm. This tutorial will introduce you to two useful techniques, the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm and the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. To get started, let's go over a few concepts first.\n",

    "# Flow network\n",
    "\n",
    "A flow network G = (V,E) is a directed graph in which each edge (u,v) ∈ E has a nonnegative capacity c(u,v) ≥ 0. We also require that if E contains an edge (u,v), then there is no edge (v,u) in the reverse direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We pick out two vertices in a flow network: the source s and the sink t. We can assume that each vertex lies on some path from the source to the sink. That is, for each vertex v ∈ V , the flow network contains a path s -> v -> t. The graph is therefore connected and, since each vertex other than s has at least one entering edge, |E| ≥ |V| - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a flow network:\n",
    "![title](network_flow.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "# Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "A flow in G is a function f : V × V → ℝ that satisfies the following two constraints for all nodes u and v:\n",
    "Capacity constraint: 0 ≤ f (u, v) ≤ c(u, v)\n",
    "Flow conservation: For all u = V - {s,t}, ∑(v ∈ V) f(v, u) = ∑(v ∈ V) f(u, v). That is, all the sum of flows that come out from u is the same as the sum that go in.\n",
    "We call the quantity f (u,v) ≥ 0 the flow from vertex u to vertex v. The value |f| of a flow f is ∑(v ∈ V) f (s, v) = ∑(v ∈ V) f (v, s). That is, the total flow out of the source minus the total flow into the source.\n",
    "In the maximum-flow problem, we are given a flow network G with source s and sink t, and we wish to find a flow of maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm solves the maximum-flow problem. It iteratively increases the value of the flow. We start with f(u, v) = 0 for all u, v ∈ V, giving an initial flow of value 0. At each iteration, we increase the flow value in G by finding an augmenting path in an associated residual network Gf. To under stand this, we need to formally define residual network and augmenting path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual network: Given a flow network G = (V,E) with source s and sink t. Let there also be a flow f in G. The residual network Gf has a capacity defined as such:\n",
    "![title](capacity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmenting path: The augmenting path is just a path from s to t in the residual network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the edges of an augmenting path in Gf, we can combine the flows on the specific edges of the augmenting path on the edges of the original flow to increase the total flow. Although each iteration of Ford-Fulkerson increases the value of the flow, the flow on any particular edge of G may increase or decrease; decreasing the flow on some edges may be necessary in order to send more flow from the source to the sink. We repeatedly augment the flow until the residual network has no more augmenting paths.\n",

    "Let's define the distance of v to source s as the length of the path found in the BFS from s to v.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemma: If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a flow network G = (V,E) with source s and sink t, then for all vertices v ∈ V - {s,t}, the distance of v in the residual network Gf increases monotonically with each flow augmentation. (The prove of this lemma can be found in Introduction to Algorithms chapter 26 under lemma 26.7.)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this lemma let's construct the following argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each flow augmentation, one edge in the residual network would reach its maximum capacity. Let's call this edge the critical edge and say edge e = (u,v) becomes the critical edge for the first time in one flow augmentation. After this flow augmentation, e would no longer exist in the residual graph because its max capacity is used. In order for e be become a critical edge again, its flow needs to be relieved in one flow augmentation and again be filled to full capacity in another augmentation. After these two augmentations, we know that the distance of v from source s must have increased by at least 2. Since there're only |V| edges in the graph, the total number of times edge e = (u,v) can become critical is at most |V|/2. Also because there's at least one critical edge in each augmentation, there can be at most |v|/2*|E| or O(V*E) augmentations. We know that the time to run a BFS in a connect graph is O(E). So the total run time is O(E)*O(VE) = O(VE^2). \n",

    "As we can see, Edmonds-Karp's complexity doesn't depend on the maximum flow value. Therefore it's much more efficient than Ford-Fulkerson in most cases. To see the advantage of Edmonds-Karp over Ford-Fulkerson. Let's see the following example.\n",

    "In this graph, a through c represent the residual network after each flow augmentation. The shaded path represents the augmenting path in each residual graph. If we run Ford-Fulkerson on this graph, it could take ϴ(E|f|) time, where |f| = 2,000,000. Specifically, Ford-Fulkerson could potentially get us stuck between the loop from a->b->c->a 1,000,000 times, depending on the sequence of access of DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "However running Edmonds-Karp on this graph would only take ϴ(VE^2) time. In this case |V| and |E| are extremely small compared with |f|. Therefore we would have an large improvement in time complexity.\n",

    "Let's consider the following real word example. Some factories need to deliver food to some villages. A networks of roads connect the factories and the villages. Each road has a certain capacity for maximum goods that can travel through it. We need to find if there is a circulation that satisfies the demand. This problem can be reduced into a simple maximum-flow problem in the following two steps:\n",
