    "# How to use GPS data to learn important places for users\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "According to statista website, in 2016, the number of mobile phone users has reached 4.61 billions. Since the mobile device has become more and more common and people spent more and more time on using mobile device, we can retreive more and more information about users based on the user behaviors that have been recorded in the mobile devices or mobile applications. GPS data is one of the most significant dataset. Through mobile GPS data obtaining from mobile application, we can understand user's movement and behavior for better user profiling. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, due the natural of GPS data, we may not retreive siginificant insight from the GPS data directly. Therefore, this tutorial will serve as a starting point for GPS data analysis. I will introduce a framework to extract some important information from the GPS dataset by filering and clustering. To be more specific, this tutorial will extract the \"important places\" for each user at the end. After going through this tutorial, you will be able to use GPS data to understand more about each user for his/her important places and you can use that to do further analysis such as movement analysis.\n"

    "This tutorial will cover several functions to process, clean and cluster user GPS data. \n",
    "1. preprocess the GPS dataset: \n",
    "    for all gps records, divide them into difference group based on UserID.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. filter out non-static GPS record: \n",

    "    \n",
    "3. Cluster GPS records to be \"location\":\n",
    "    after we obtain static GPS records for each user, we can start to cluster the records based on latitude and longitude. This step is important since GPS data is very granular and sensitive and the GPS coordinate for a physical location may vary ,we should group the places to a location to make the study more useful. Since location-based data is a special type of data, we will use a variant of K-mean clustering algorithm which will cluster the data based on given radius instead of number of K.\n",

Therefore, since the GPS coordinate for a physical location may vary, we should group the places into a location to make the study more useful. Here, we will use a variant of k-kean clustering algorithm to cluster the location-based GPS data.\n",

After apply the GPS dataset to this algorithm, you can have a better understanding for your users. In this case, you will be able to porvide better or further service to users. One example is about the advertising. If you know where are the important places for your users, you can post the most relevant advertisement to them and increase the response rate to the advertisement. \n",

    "Furthermore, this tutorial is just the starting point of a GPS dataset analysis. After you have the place information, you can apply markov model or association rules to it. For markov model, since you now have the cluster visited sequence, you can use markov model to predict the movement of the users. For example, you will have better idea of, if a user go to place(cluster)1, he/she may go to place(cluster)2 next according to the sequence analysis using markove model. \n",
