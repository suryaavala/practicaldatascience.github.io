    "## Introduction\n",

    "Topological sort has more and more usage in real world and data science field now. For instance, not only the build system, it can also do instruction scheduling, deciding the order of load tables with foreign keys in databases, ordering the formula cell evaluation in spreadsheets, and so on. One of the famous application is that apt-get use topological sorting to get the best sequence in which a set of packages can be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will provide a brief introduction for Topological sorting. In the directed graph, topological sorting is the linear ordering of the whole vertexes that for every edge uv, vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering. In addition, there may have multiple topological sorting result for a directed graph, and topological sorting can not use in the graph which is not directed graph.\n",

    "We have a directed graph shown above. One topological ordering result could be A->B->C->E->D->F, another ordering could be B->A->C->D->E->F. So the point here is that vertex C is never comes before vertex A and vertex B in the ordering, vertex E should never comes before C, and F should never comes before E and D, and so on. One of the application of topological sorting in data science is the usage of dependency relationship between each vertex. Suppose this graph is the realationship of vertexes, and we can see that C has dependency on A and B, and D has dependency on C, and so on. So if we use the topological sorting to create one of the ordering to know the ordering of each vertexes, and then solve the issue by dependency in this order. Like one realistic example usage in Twitter data analytics, we can use topological sorting algorithm to find all the relationship between follower and followee on Twitter."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological sorting algorithm has been used in data science and more and more fields now. Although its concept is easy and mainly used for scheduling between jobs, the application today is broad and critical. For example, ordering of formula cell evaluation in spreadsheets, deciding the order of load tables with foreign keys in databases, logic synthesis, data serialization, determining the symbol dependencies, analizing the follower/followee relationship on Twitter, and so on. The apt-get application is one of the famous usage of topological sorting algorithm. Although topological sorting algorithm may just be a tiny part of what we should learn and understand in data science field, it still be useful and help you be familiar with not only a single algorithm but more about how to analyze graph and retrieve data in the future.\n"
