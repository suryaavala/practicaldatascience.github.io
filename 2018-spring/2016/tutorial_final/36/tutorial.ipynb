It often looks scary as the first glance, hope we can learn regular expression better together through this tutorial. In this tutorial, I will mainly cover:\n",

Noted that there is an imporant concept call **group(s)** in the regular expression. Group means that by using `()` to \"group\" the pattern you want, you can get the group(s) of string you want to match, as well as the corresponding indexes! Formally speaking, we can concate different subpattern using parenthesis to a large pattern to match a string.

It's actually caused by the **Backslash character (`'\\'`)**. `'\\'` indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be normal in regular expression. However, this conflicts with the string literal, which makes it simply to be a escape sign. In short, matching **a** literal backslash `'\\'` in a string, one has to write **\"\\\\\\\\\"** as the RE string, because the regular expression must be \\\\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\\\ inside a Python string literal. The `r` at the start of the pattern string designates a python \"raw\" string which **passes through backslashes without change.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look for the following examples, noted that in the first parameters in the `re.match`, it should be a pattern string, whereas in the second parameters, it's a string. `\"\\\\\"` in a string means the single `\"\\\"`"
