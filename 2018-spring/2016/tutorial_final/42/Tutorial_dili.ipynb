In fact,a digital image is nothing more than a bunch of datas which indicating variations of red, green, and blue at a particular location on a grid of pixels. Most of the time, we just view this pixels as miniature rectangles and with little creative thinking on making some lower level maniupulation of pixels with code. In this tutorial, we will work on such pixels. Also, I will introduce `OpenCV` (Open Source Computer Vision),which is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.\n"
