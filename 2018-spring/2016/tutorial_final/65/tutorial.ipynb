    "### What is RNN\n",
    "A recurrent neural network(RNN) is a class of aritificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal states of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. It can be applied on machine translation, speech recognition, generating image descriptions. It is different from traditional neural network, which assume all inputs and outputs are independent of each other. RNN performs the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being depended on the previous computations. Another way to think about RNNs is that they have a \"memory\" which captures information about what has been calculated so far. In theory RNNs can make use of information in arbitrarily long sequences, but in practice they are limited to looking back only a few steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "The above diagram shows a RNN being unrolled into a full network. By unrollying we simply mean that we write out the network for the complete sequence. For example, if the sequence we care about is a sentence of 5 words, the network would be unrolled into a 5-layer neural network, one layer for each word. The formulas that govern the computation happening in a RNN are as follows:\n",
    "1. x_t is the input at time step t. For example, x_1 could be a one-hot vector corresponding to the second word of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. s_t is the hidden state at time step t. It’s the “memory” of the network. s_t is calculated based on the previous hidden state and the input at the current step: s_t=f(Ux_t + Ws_{t-1}). The function f usually is a nonlinearity such as tanh or ReLU.  s_{-1}, which is required to calculate the first hidden state, is typically initialized to all zeroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. o_t is the output at step t. For example, if we wanted to predict the next word in a sentence it would be a vector of probabilities across our vocabulary. o_t = \\mathrm{softmax}(Vs_t).\n"

    "From the figure in the top of the tutorial, the input will be a sequence of words and each $x_t$ is a single word. But there's one more thing: Because of how matrix multiplication works we can't simply use a word index as an input. Instead, we represent each word as a one-hot vector of size vocabulary_size. So, each $x_t$ will become a vector, and $x$ will be a matrix, with each row representing a word. Here in the following, we will perform this transformation in our Neural Network code instead of doing it in pre-processing. The output of our network $o$ has a similar format. Each $o_t$ is a vector of `vocabulary_size` elements, and each element represents the probability of that word being the next word in the sentence.\n",

Note that because $x_t$ is a one-hot vector, multiplying it with $U$ is essentially the same as selecting a column of U, so we don't need to perform the full multiplication. Then, the biggest matrix multiplication in our network is $Vs_t$. That's why we want to keep our vocabulary size small if possible.\n",

    "As the purpose of recurrent nets is to accurately classify sequential input. We rely on the backpropagation of error and gradient descent to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation in feedforward networks moves backward from the final error through the outputs, weights and inputs of each hiddent layer, assigning those weights responsibility for a portion of the error by calculating their partial derivatives - ∂E/∂w, or the relationship between their rates of change. Those derivatives are then used by our learning rule, gradient descent, to adjust the weights up or down, whichever direction decreases error. Recurrent networks rely on an extension of backpropagation called backpropagation through time, or BPTT. Time, in this case, is simply expressed by a well-defined, ordered series of calculations linking one time step to the next, which is all backpropagation needs to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in our example, we want to find the parameters $U,V$ and $W$ that minimize the total loss on the training data. The most common way to do this is SGD, Stochastic Gradient Descent. The idea behind SGD is pretty simple. We iterate over all our training examples and during each iteration we nudge the parameters into a direction that reduces the error. These directions are given by the gradients on the loss: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial U}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial V}, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W}$. SGD also needs a *learning rate*, which defines how big of a step we want to make in each iteration. SGD is the most popular optimization method not only for Neural Networks, but also for many other Machine Learning algorithms. As such there has been a lot of research on how to optimize SGD using batching, parallelism and adaptive learning rates. \n",
