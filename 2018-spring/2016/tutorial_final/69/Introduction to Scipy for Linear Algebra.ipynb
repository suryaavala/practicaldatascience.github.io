    "Linear algebra is essential in multiple areas of science. Since linear equations are easy to solve, modern science, including mathematics, physics and engineering contains models of linear equations. For example, In physics, linear algebra can be applied to solve Maxwell’s equations. In data science, we use linear regression to predict the result on a large set of training data. This tutorial will introduce a powerful library SciPy, which provides key functions to utilize linear algebra. \n",

    "As an extension of NumPy, SciPy provides mathematical algorithms and high-level data processing routines, including optimization, regression, etc. With SciPy, users can easily manipulate data with high-level commands.\n",
