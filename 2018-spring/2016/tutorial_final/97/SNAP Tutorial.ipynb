    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to some basic methods for processing and analyzing network data, particularly focusing on large scale network analytics using Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP). Networks are a general language for describing complex systems. They can be used to present information like connections between friends and families, societies, road networks, neuron interactions in the brain, and global economic networks. Network data forms a key aspect of data science. In many settings we want to visualize or analyze data with a network component: where information can be represented using nodes (mostly entities) and edges (mostly relationship between entities). Networks are means to represent such kind of data. Visualizing the network data and understanding key network statistics tells us a great deal about some question we are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this is the degrees of separation statistics, which Facebook reported recently:\n",
    "[<img src=\"https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t39.2365-6/12683879_1559394484383614_1037808524_n.png\">](https://research.facebook.com/blog/three-and-a-half-degrees-of-separation/)\"Each person in the world (at least among the 1.59 billion people active on Facebook) is connected to every other person by an average of three and a half other people. The average distance we observe is 4.57, corresponding to 3.57 intermediaries or 'degrees of separation.'\" The network here has Facebook users as nodes and friendships as edges. Degrees of separation is the average number of nodes on the path from any one node to another in the graph/network (we will use these two terms interchangeably)."

    "As the second example application in this tutorial, I wanted to show how we can detect communities in the entire Stack Overflow Data (we were only using the posts related to Java above) and then look at the communities to get a sense of how they vary in terms of questions tags/topics in each. Turns out that the larger dataset (>3.5 million edges and ~0.8 million nodes) is too big and community detection methods in SNAP could not give an answer even in several hours. This is a common problem is network analysis. When the network gets too big, computation becomes very time-consuming. One of the common techniques used in network analysis to deal with such scenarios is graph sparsification, where we take a representative sample from the network to estimate its properties. Sparsification  is approximating a given graph by a graph with fewer edges or vertices.\n",
