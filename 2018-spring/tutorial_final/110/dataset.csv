"             I am considering English MOOCs in which participants of the MOOC expect to improve their Communication skills in English. Many people are taking such courses because they lack enough practice of speaking in English. The main reason for this is they feel shy to start to communicate in English. The most important step to excel in conversational English is, to START speaking in English. 
             So as a part of the assignment of these courses, it will be better to add something like chatting(we can add software to MOOC platform)  with other (unknown)students at least an hour in a week. Make it a mandatory assignment. Also they should chat with at least 5 to 10 different peers. This will make these courses more beneficial to students than expected by them.

"Based on my experience with MOOCs, I have taken more than 20 in the past year. All these were taught in English, being a non-native English, an improvement is that it has subtitles in other languages, where are concentrated most students who do not speak English such as Chinese, Spanish or Portuguese. I know that some courses have taken this into account and of students who have previously participated in the course have signed for captioning in your language. Because many people who are interested in enrolling in MOOCs but which is in English and though you have English subtitles, this is still a barrier to learning, so do not enroll in courses. I also think it is important to help these students within the teaching assistants of the courses, there are people who are not native English speakers because they can better target because they know the challenge of taking the course is not in native language.
In my case, it was useful that the courses have English subtitles, taking the course in this language has allowed me to improve my English skills especially listening and writing, which I had to implement the courses.

Among them, college students are spending incredibly expensive cost for being 'exchange students' or even parents of preschoolers are hiring private Englsih teacher to help their children to go to top branded universities and colleges since thier certificate of graduation from top branded colleges have been used for them to generate profits and many Koreans believe good college education will bring them a better life or to be successful in the end. Ability to utilize English language is a key to differencitate people from those who have 'ALL' and 'NOTHING' in the  Hell Chosun Dynasty. MOOCs, therefore, need to create a system that will connect socially less fortunate Koreans with top branded schools in Seoul especially and thier credits will be transferable. ",yes

"Hai, Myself Shrihari from India.
 1.I guess MOOCs can develop an a system like introducing audio directory in native languages while you play videos in the courses so that those who feel trouble in understanding english captions can grasp the concepts in their native languages. 
2.One more thing that I wanted to suggest is that students who aren't from a good english background find some difficulty in participating actively in discussion forums.So with the aid of artificial intelligence MOOCs can think to introduce a system which receives students thoughts in their native language and then convert into English, Because my personal opinion is ideas matter a lot than language.
I hope for best!

I mean, it's important to give students other alternatives to continue improving their knowledge after the ending of the course. This, because I think the learning of other languages needs to be develop every single day and with every single opportunity a student can catch. So, if there are more possibilities and if it is easier to improve your English after the course, you should take it.
On the other side, I think that for students who are non-native English speakers, and I said this since my experience, it's very difficult to don't translate what you are going to say and then search the way to say it in English. Also, it's very difficult to learn cultural ways to speak because in most schools and institutes they teach only the basic of the language but it's known that if you want to achieve a higher level of English you need to completely understand what the people is saying and this is not possible if you can't get that additional information.",yes

In other words depending on the age category one can predict the level of English knowledge of native English speakers (at least up to the age of 25). However, this classification does not apply to non-Native English Speakers. Both a 10 year old and a 50 year old non-native English speakers can have the same level of English knowledge. More importantly, the pace they want to learn or master English can greatly differ. Where as a 10 year old might be willing to spend 10 years to gain an acceptable competency in English while the 50 year old might want to gain the same level know English knowledge in one or two years who is also willing to dedicate more time to learn English than the 10 year old individual.",yes

"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently gained worldwide attention from educational institutes. MOOCs provide a new option for learning, yet measurable learning benefits of MOOCs still need to be investigated. Collecting data of three MOOCs at Yuan Ze University (YZU), this paper intended to classify learning behaviors among 1489 students on the MOOC platform at YZU. This study further examined learning outcomes in MOOCs by different types of learners. The Ward‚Äôs hierarchical and k-means non-hierarchical clustering methods were employed to classify types of learners‚Äô behavior while they engaged in learning activities on the MOOC platform. Three types of MOOC learners were classified‚Äîactive learner, passive learner, and bystander. Active learners who submitted assignments on time and frequently watched lecture videos showed a higher completion rate and a better grade in the course. MOOC learners who participated in online discussion forum reported a higher rate of passing the course and a better score than those inactive classmates. The finding of this study suggested that the first 2 weeks was a critical point of time to retain students in MOOCs. MOOC instructors need to carefully design course and detect risk behaviors of students in early of the classes to prevent students from dropping out of the course. The feature design of discussion forum is to provide peer interaction and facilitate online learning. Our results suggested that timely feedback by instructors or facilitators on discussion forum could enhance students‚Äô engagement in MOOCs.",yes
