The big advantage of bona fide stereo separation is hard to beat for the money; the MK402BT sells for just $98 a pair.</p><p>The Dayton Audio MK402BT speakers</p><p>When I had them spread five feet apart, the MK402BTs' stereo was wonderfully spacious, with a fair degree of soundstage depth. While I didn't have a HomePod or Home Max on hand for direct comparisons, I know those bad boys deliver more potent bass. Still, the MK402BT's bass is definitely adequate.</p><p>The MK402BT speakers are the active version of one of our new favorite budget designs: the <span class=\"link\" section=\"shortcodeLink\"><a href=\"/products/dayton-audio-mk402/review/\">MK402</a></span>. As well as offering a wired connection, they also include Bluetooth connectivity. </p><p>Like the original, this is a two-way speaker with a 4-inch treated paper woofer and a 0.75-inch soft dome tweeter. The internal power amplifier is rated at 20 watts per channel. The cabinet is finished in a black vinyl wrapped and a set of removable black cloth grilles. Each MK402BT measures 9.5 by 5.75 by 6.6 inches.</p><p>The top panel of the right MK402BT speaker has volume up/down buttons, a Mode button that switches between wired and <a href=\"/tags/bluetooth/\" data-annotation=\"true\" data-component=\"linkTracker\" data-link-tracker-options='{\"action\":\"inline-annotation|Bluetooth|CNET_TAG|556\"}'>Bluetooth</a> operation, and a play/pause button for Bluetooth playback. You can also control volume from your phone. The right speaker's rear panel hosts a 3.5mm stereo analog input jack, and the speaker output connectors you'll use to hook up to the left speaker with the included 6.5 foot long cable. Please note, the speakers rear panels have bass ports so don't jam them right up against the wall, a couple of inches of clearance will do. If you're cramped for space feel free to put the two MK402BT speakers right alongside each other.</p><p>I'm not claiming the MK402BT will satisfy fussy audiophiles -- the sound has an edge that grates when the speakers are played at moderate or loud volume. That said, the MK402BT's sound quality improves when you turn off Bluetooth and go for a wired connection with my <a href=\"/products/apple-iphone-6s/\" data-annotation=\"true\" data-component=\"linkTracker\" data-link-tracker-options='{\"action\":\"inline-annotation|Apple iPhone 6S|CNET_FAM_SERIES|225\"}'>iPhone 6S</a>. Yes, wired connections have a tendency to sound better than Bluetooth, and this was the case with the MK402BT. </p><p>With a wired connection, the MK402BT sound is on par with what I recall from my recent listening sessions with the passive (non-amplified) <a href=\"/products/dayton-audio-mk402/review/\" data-annotation=\"true\" data-component=\"linkTracker\" data-link-tracker-options='{\"action\":\"inline-annotation|Dayton Audio MK402|CNET_FAM_SERIES|435\"}'>Dayton Audio MK402</a> speakers that sell for $69 a pair. If you don't care about Bluetooth and have an amplifier or receiver, the MK402 is a sweet little speaker for the money. </p><p>I set up the MK402BTs in my wife's studio, with the speakers in the corners of the 10-foot-wide room, so stereo separation was impressive. Listening to the \"Isle of Dogs\" film soundtrack with its pounding drums and percussion, the little MK402BTs belted out decent impact. With Yo La Tengo's new album \"There's a Riot Going On,\" the sound mix emphasizes space and atmosphere; the MK402BTs let me hear all of that in ways that a single HomePod or Home Max cannot. </p><p>I mostly listened to the MK402BT via Bluetooth because that's how I imagine most people will use these speakers, and my main complaint was the treble isn't all that clear. Opting for the wired connection helps smooth out the treble a bit.  </p><p>One minor annoyance: when you turn on the MK402BT speakers, they play an annoying sound effect, and as far as I can tell there's no way to stop it from doing that.</p><p>Still, for $98 <a href=\"/topics/speakers/best-speakers/bluetooth/\" data-annotation=\"true\" data-component=\"linkTracker\" data-link-tracker-options='{\"action\":\"inline-annotation|bluetooth speaker|CNET_EVERGREEN|510\"}'>Bluetooth speakers</a>, the Dayton Audio MK402BT sounds like a really good deal to me.</p>\n",

      "<p>Behold the majesty of the <a href=\"http://vivaaudio.com/en/products/egoista/\" target=\"_blank\" data-component=\"externalLink\">Viva Egoista 845</a>, some might say it's too large to be a headphone amp -- it's more akin to an integrated amp -- but it's gloriously over the top. No one needs an Egoista 845, but no one needs a 789 horsepower Ferrari either, but if you have the means, why not? I think of the Egoista 845 as the 812 Superfast of headphone amps, they both exist for moneyed folks who crave the very best, practicality be damned. This much I know for sure, the Egoista 845's sound with the best headphones is va-va-voom fabulous. And at $13,800, it's a whole lot more affordable than the $335,275 <span class=\"link\" section=\"shortcodeLink\"><a href=\"/news/ferrari-812-superfast-carfection-review/\">Ferrari 812 Superfast</a></span> we covered here at CNET. </p><p>The Viva Egoista 845 headphone amplifier.</p><p>My all too brief encounter with the Egoista took place at <a href=\"http://theheadphoneannex.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-component=\"externalLink\">the Headphone Annex</a>, at the <a href=\"http://inlivingstereo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-component=\"externalLink\">In Living Stereo</a> audio showroom in New York. The amp has been in production since 2014, but it's just now that I finally got to spend some quality listening time with it. Egoista certainly lived up to my expectations, the amp's sound has soul, lots of it.</p><p>Power is rated at 15 watts per channel, and while that sort of juice isn't required with most headphones, it'll come in handy with the cutting edge breed of headphones like the <span class=\"link\" section=\"shortcodeLink\"><a href=\"/news/the-audiophiliacs-top-10-full-size-headphones-for-2015/\">Audeze LCD4</a></span>, <span class=\"link\" section=\"shortcodeLink\"><a href=\"/news/listening-to-a-6k-headphone-and-loving-every-second-if-it/\">Hifiman Susvara</a></span> and the <span class=\"link\" section=\"shortcodeLink\"><a href=\"/news/abyss-ab-1266-headphones-run-5495-but-theyre-worth-it/\">Abyss AB 1266</a></span> headphones. Those power hungry beasts have humbled many a high-end headphone amp, but Egoista breathes life into those headphones. I've noted over the years that a lot of high-end headphone owners <em>collect</em> headphones, and it's those guys who buy very high-end amplifiers like the Egoista. It's good to be rich.</p><p>The amp lacks digital connectivity, analog connectivity runs to four pairs of stereo RCA inputs, and one direct input that bypasses the Egoista's preamp stages. There are separate left and right channel balanced XLR headphone jacks, two stereo XLR headphone jacks, plus two standard 6.3mm headphone jacks. For technically inclined readers the Egoista is a zero negative feedback, pure Class A circuit design with one 6N1P tube, one 6SN7GTB tube, two 845 tubes, and two EH5U4GB tubes. </p><p>The Egoista is hand crafted in Italy, and features specially designed output transformers designed for use exclusively with headphones.</p><p>The Viva Egoista 845, with Focal Utopia headphones to the left. </p><p>While you might expect the Egoista's sound might be overly rich and warm with six tubes, it never once sounded that way. The sound was neutral and stunningly clear, you never got the feeling the Egoista was coloring the sound, it certainly did not.</p><p>I listened with a few different sets of headphones, including my <span class=\"link\" section=\"shortcodeLink\"><a href=\"/news/abyss-ab-1266-headphones-run-5495-but-theyre-worth-it/\">Abyss AB-1266</a></span>, and while I know this headphone well, it sounded shockingly better with the Egoista. First the midrange was more natural with voices, it sounded more human than I've heard from this or any other headphone before. The purity of the sound, the sheer immediacy of it grabbed and held my attention. The AB-1266's out-of-head imaging is always a treat, but it's even more so with the Egoista. The Focal Utopia headphone was beyond vivid, and even the more affordable headphones like the $599<a href=\"http://personal.audioquest.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-component=\"externalLink\"> AudioQuest NightHawk </a>was transformed by the Egoista. </p><p>If the <a href=\"http://vivaaudio.com/en/products/egoista/\" target=\"_blank\" data-component=\"externalLink\">Viva Egoista 845's</a> price is out of bounds the company also offers the somewhat smaller Egoista 2A3 tube headphone amp for $9,750 in the US. The prices are for the amps in Viva's standard painted finishes, custom ordered automotive paint finished amps are available for a $500 upcharge for either Egoista amp.</p>\n",

      "I'll cut right to the chase: the Dayton Audio MK402BT two-speaker system fills a room better than any single speaker could: whether thats a $349 Apple HomePod or a $399 Google Home Max smart speaker. The big advantage of bona fide stereo separation is hard to beat for the money; the MK402BT sells for just $98 a pair. The Dayton Audio MK402BT speakersWhen I had them spread five feet apart the MK402BTs' stereo was wonderfully spacious with a fair degree of soundstage depth. While I didn't have a HomePod or Home Max on hand for direct comparisons I know those bad boys deliver more potent bass. Still the MK402BT's bass is definitely adequate. The MK402BT speakers are the active version of one of our new favorite budget designs: the MK402. As well as offering a wired connection they also include Bluetooth connectivity.  Like the original this is a two-way speaker with a 4-inch treated paper woofer and a 0. 75-inch soft dome tweeter. The internal power amplifier is rated at 20 watts per channel. The cabinet is finished in a black vinyl wrapped and a set of removable black cloth grilles. Each MK402BT measures 9. 5 by 5. 75 by 6. 6 inches. The top panel of the right MK402BT speaker has volume up/down buttons a Mode button that switches between wired and Bluetooth operation and a play/pause button for Bluetooth playback. You can also control volume from your phone. The right speaker's rear panel hosts a 3. 5mm stereo analog input jack and the speaker output connectors you'll use to hook up to the left speaker with the included 6. 5 foot long cable. Please note the speakers rear panels have bass ports so don't jam them right up against the wall a couple of inches of clearance will do. If you're cramped for space feel free to put the two MK402BT speakers right alongside each other. I'm not claiming the MK402BT will satisfy fussy audiophiles -- the sound has an edge that grates when the speakers are played at moderate or loud volume. That said the MK402BT's sound quality improves when you turn off Bluetooth and go for a wired connection with my iPhone 6S. Yes wired connections have a tendency to sound better than Bluetooth and this was the case with the MK402BT. With a wired connection the MK402BT sound is on par with what I recall from my recent listening sessions with the passive (non-amplified) Dayton Audio MK402 speakers that sell for $69 a pair. If you don't care about Bluetooth and have an amplifier or receiver the MK402 is a sweet little speaker for the money.  I set up the MK402BTs in my wife's studio with the speakers in the corners of the 10-foot-wide room so stereo separation was impressive. Listening to the \"Isle of Dogs\" film soundtrack with its pounding drums and percussion the little MK402BTs belted out decent impact. With Yo La Tengo's new album \"There's a Riot Going On\" the sound mix emphasizes space and atmosphere; the MK402BTs let me hear all of that in ways that a single HomePod or Home Max cannot. I mostly listened to the MK402BT via Bluetooth because that's how I imagine most people will use these speakers and my main complaint was the treble isn't all that clear. Opting for the wired connection helps smooth out the treble a bit.  One minor annoyance: when you turn on the MK402BT speakers they play an annoying sound effect and as far as I can tell there's no way to stop it from doing that. Still for $98 Bluetooth speakers the Dayton Audio MK402BT sounds like a really good deal to me. \n"
