The thing I disliked most about the tutorial assignment was the disconnect between the word limit and the lines of code limit.  The assignment expects about one to two sentences for each line of code, that is, 10 to 20 words per line of code.  For my tutorial topic, this was far too restrictive, and it was difficult to artificially increase the number of lines of code and decrease the number of words.  My intuition is that the more topics that have a more algorithmic focus would have the same problem, since each line of code is more complicated and requires more words to describe.
