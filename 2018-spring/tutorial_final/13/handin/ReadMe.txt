To view the tutorial, please use the html file attached alongside. If you try to run the Jupyter Notebook directly, it might not work as you may not have bokeh installed on your computer.
To test out and play around with the code: 
1. Please download the datasets into the directory where you store the notebook. 
2. Install bokeh by running the command 'pip install bokeh' in your command line
3. Install the bokeh sample data by running the code for sample data given in the notebook
4. Enjoy the visualizations and play around with the code to learn more.

Note: The datasets are available on this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=111fa71h7ZNyZ2eMzO27vYS-_vTy02bK9
