Evaluation metrics help us gauge the performance of a model and are able to discriminate among the different model designs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Classification problems are the most common type of machine learning problem. It also has many different metrics for evaluation. We try to measure the performance of a Classifier of the given Classification problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance measured is not just a count of correct classifications, classifiers produce a score that could aid in getting the thresholded to decide the classification. A score is usually between 0.0 which indicates definitely negative and 1.0 which indicates definitely positive.In general, we consider a score above 0.5 as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we apply any threshold to the given dataset at hand in which PP is the positive population and NP is the negative population. We will further get true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). We need a method which will take into account all of these numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are able to calculate the measures for all the above values, some useful metrics can be calculated as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accuracy (which indicates (1 – Error) ) = (TP + TN)/(PP + NP) = Pr(C)\n",
    "        where Pr(C) indicates the probability of a correct classification\n",
    "    Sensitivity (also known as Recall) = TP/(TP + FN) = TP / PP \n",
    "         this measures the proportion of positive values that are correctly identified as such\n",
    "    Specificity = TN/(TN + FP) = TN / NP\n",
    "         this measures the proportion of negative values that are correctly identified as such \n",
    "    Precision (also called positive predictive value) = fraction of relevant values among the retrieved values\n",

    "Unlike the above two metrics, here we will need to calculate `y_scores`, which in our example we will call ypred_knn. It is done by predicting the probability scores on the test data. It represents the target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive class or confidence values."

    "\n",
    "To conclude I'd like to state that performing any kind of classification or regression is pointless if it is not continously checked for it's performance. Also, measuring the performance on only the training sample is point less. But splitting the data may somtimes cause to make selection bias.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to tackle variance and bias aspects, the K-Fold cross validation gives us a way to use every datapoint at hand, which can reduce this selection bias to a large extent. Also, as we saw in classification and in regression, K-fold cross validation can be used with any modelling technique.\n",
