    "The web crawler, which can also be called internet bot or web spider, is an application program that scan through the internet programmatically and fetch the data for further use. After almost thirty years of development, the web spider can be categorized into four major types, include general purpose web crawler, focused web crawler, incremental web crawler and deep web crawler. Besides other types of web crawler, we will focus on implementing the general purpose web crawler in this tutorial. More specifically, we will make use of the Scrapy library in python to implement a basic web crawler to grab some information about food ingredients through [BBC Food Channel](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/ingredients), format the data as JSON and display them in the notebook."
