    "> \"The TrueSkill ranking system is a skill based ranking system for Xbox Live developed at Microsoft Research. The purpose of a ranking system is to both identify and track the skills of gamers in a game (mode) in order to be able to match them into competitive matches. The TrueSkill ranking system only uses the final standings of all teams in a game in order to update the skill estimates (ranks) of all gamers playing in this game. Ranking systems have been proposed for many sports but possibly the most prominent ranking system in use today is ELO.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It assume that the skill of a given player conforms Normal Distribution. By playing more and more games, the system knows you better, so the Ïƒ will be lower and lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "![skill](skill.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a team game, it assumes that the skill of a team is the sum of the skills of its players. In this way we can use it for **sports prediction**: by training the skills of the players based on the history games, we can predict the results of the upcoming games, which are always the dreams of sport fans!\n",
