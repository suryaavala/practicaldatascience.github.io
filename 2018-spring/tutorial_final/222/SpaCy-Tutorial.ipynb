    "# Introduction to SpaCy and Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is centered on Spacy, a syntactic parser often used in natural language processing. We will be looking at some basic use cases for this NLP library. Natural language processing deals with machines understanding and decoding human language. Given the inherent complexity of speech, this isn't an easy task. The ambiguity of language is what necessitates libraries like Spacy to help break down human language to machine understandable formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spacy is a free open source library, published by Explosion AI that holds the distinction of being the fastest syntactic parser and is built using Cython and Python. It's a helpful tool to figure out context/ themes of text, how words are related to each other, similarities between words etc. Spacy can be used as a pre-processing step in applications like sentiment analysis and areas that require information retrieval or deep learning. I've felt that this was a pretty useful tool to get a quick analysis of text and then decide what I can do with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation using the pip installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -U spacy`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using conda for your work:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge spacy`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaCy has a rich linguistic features set allowing for text classification, training and more. The features [1] that are covered in this tutorial are: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | What it does |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "|Lemmatization| Finds the lemma or base of a word. Eg: the lemma of mice -> mouse, is -> be.|  \n",
    "|Named Entity Recognition (NER)| Identifies categories for real world objects. Labels are based on type, i.e. person, location etc.|\n",
    "|Tokenization| Splits text into words, punctuation marks etc.|\n",
    "|Sentence Boundary Detection| Identifies sentence limits and segments text into sentences.|\n",
    "|Parts of Speech (PoS) tagging|Gives the relationship between tokens (root of a sentence, subject, object)|\n",
    "\n",
    "There are statistical packages that support some of SpaCy's linguistic predictions. These models are offered in 8 languages like English, Spanish, German and Portuguese. Choosing a language module would depend on the reason you are using SpaCy and the type of text you have.  I will be using the English model. This model comes with lexical entries (words and their attributes), binary weights for some of the taggers, word vectors (to help with word similarities), and configuration options like processing pipeline options for loading the model you need[2].\n",

    ">To look at some of the use cases, I have used a dataset [3] that contains 129 speeches delivered by former President, Barack Obama. The following code saves the speech data in two formats - a text string of 20 speeches together (20 for ease of use and a simple glimpse of how SpaCy can help) and a list of all the speeches. "

Each pipeline component is created and added to the process pipeline. spacy.load finally returns a modified language class to use as a nlp object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipelines [4]\n",
    "> The nlp object tokenizes text to form a Doc object (tokenizer). Doc goes through a processing pipeline, that by default consists of a parser (part-of-speech tags), tagger (dependency labels for sentence structure) and entity recognizer (named entities). The pipeline is a chain of transformation where each component processes and gives out a modified Doc object. Custom components can also be added to the pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Deciding what components you need can make a significant difference in terms of speed memory usage. This can be done by using the 'disable' option in spacy.load.
