    "This tutorial will introduce the basics of using Plotly for interactive data visualization. Visualizing data through graphs and plots lets us to explore patterns, trends, and even interactions between covariates. Adding an interactive element allows us to further break down these patterns over time or by another variable, as you will see later on. Many bloggers and news outlets are turning to interactive graphs to demonstrate their data-driven conclusions as they are more fun and easier to understand by the common reader. See the Wall Street Journal for some fun examples: http://graphics.wsj.com/wsj-interactives-2015/.\n",

    "-  longitude: geospatial longitude, precision to 5 places\n",
    "-  name: station name, str\n",
