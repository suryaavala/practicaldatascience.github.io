    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have covered relational databases in class and learned about entity relationships between table in a relational database, not all data can be organized in a structured manner. In this tutorial, we examine the uses and advantages of non-relational databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis. In particular, we delve into the capabilities of Redis and how we can apply it to data science problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we note some main differences between relational databases and a non-relational database __(SQL vs. NoSQL)__:\n",
    "- The schema for a SQL database must be predefined, while NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.\n",
    "- SQL databases represent data in the form of table, while NoSQL databases have no specific schema. In the case of Redis, data is key-value pairs.\n",
    "- SQL databases are typically scaled \"vertically,\" by improving hardware on a single server, while NoSQL databases scale \"horizontally,\" by distributting the database across more servers.\n",
    "- All SQL Databases use SQL style syntax, while NoSQL databases' syntax vary.\n"

    "## Motivation\n",
    "As a motivation to use a NoSQL database for data science, consider the following problems:\n",
    "- You are working for Amazon and your task is to find analyze order in which pages on Amazon get visited. In particular, you want to find paths that lead to visitors becoming customers and Is there a path that leads to visitors leaving? Both would be good to know. Given enough of this data, it would be possible to generate suggested pages that lead to more customers, but first, you would like to store the data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is possible to come up with a SQL schema for this problem, most implementations would be either very inefficient or would violate the relational nature of the database. As a result, we turn to a NoSQL database, Redis, and show that such a problem can be easily solved."
