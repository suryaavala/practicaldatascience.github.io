    "\n",
    "Currently, there are already many existing libraries like Keras that we can use without knowing the underlying theory, but it can be good for you to know a little bit of how neural network works before you lay hands on the libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic unit of a neural network is called a neuron. It receives the input data and apply some function, which we usually call activation function, to the input data and output the result. The picture is from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-neural-networks-series-part-1-2b90b87795bc).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='pictures/neuron.gif'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a neural network can have many layers, each with many neurons. A very classic neural network is a fully connected network, in which each neuron in one layer is connected to all the neurons in the following layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you input your data into the neural network, each neuron in the input layer will receive your data and apply the activation function to it, such as softmax or tanh, to produce an output and feed the output to all the neurons in the next layer. Then each neuron in the next layer will receive all the outputs from all neurons from the previous layer and do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network use gradient descent algorithm to perform optimization of the model. Gradient descent is a way to minimize an objective function parameterized by a model's parameters by updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function to the parameters. When the network model outputs the final result from the input data, it will calculate the lossand propagate the loss back to the network. Then each neuron will update its weights and bias of its activation function. You can regard this process as a feedback to the network so that the netowrk could learn from the loss and try to give more accurate predictions netxt time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more details about neural networks, [blogs by Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) are awesome materials."

The reasons why RNN is so good at capture the sequential learning is that it keeps the information it learnt from the previous time steps when processing the current input. We won't dive into the theory behind RNN too deep here. You can check this [post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) for more details.\n",
