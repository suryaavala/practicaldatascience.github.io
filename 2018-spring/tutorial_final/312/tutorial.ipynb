A primary goal of data visulization is to communicate information to users. Effective visulization will give people more information hidden behind data and a deeper understanding of the data. One way to accomplish that goal is making the plot interactive. \n",

Although this is better than show x,y,z value in a table it still not effective enough, e.g, we want to know a certain point's value on the line or we are interested in the projection of this line in xz-plane. If we can click at some point and get the value or drag the plot and get different perspectives of it, that's called interactive.\n",

A refer is an HTTP header field that identifies the address of the webpage that linked to the resource being requested.\n",
