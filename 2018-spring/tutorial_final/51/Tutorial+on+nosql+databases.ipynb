    "\n",
    "<a id=\"0.1\"><h3> 0.1 Motivation of the Tutorial</h3></a>\n",
    "The exponential increase in data in recent years has highlighted the challenges and limitations to store and manage data solely using traditional relational databases. Even though some RDBMS now support NoSQL features, the results are oftentimes unsatisfactory, which gives NoSQL databases a niche market to build specific solutions to address less structured data in a distributed manner efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"0.2\"><h3> 0.2 Goal of the Tutorial</h3></a>\n",
    "This tutorial will take you to explore some of the mainstream nosql databases on the market. I will explain the core concepts of using each database and touch upon their strengths and weaknesses. Meanwhile, I will walk you through how to use python to interact with these databases. However, I won't be naming all the query syntax as you can find that online easily. I will just be giving you one or two examples based on the twitter data scraped from HW1. After completing this tutorial, you will acquire some sense on picking the right database and have adequate knoweldge to work with nosql databases independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"0.3\"><h3> 0.3 Meaning and Features of NoSQL</h3></a>\n",
    "NoSQL means Not Only SQL, implying that when designing a software solution or product, there may be more than one storage mechanism that could be used based on users' needs. There is no prescriptive definition for NoSQL, but we can still observe they have following commnoalities, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not using SQL\n",
    "* Support running on clusters\n",
    "* Mostly open-source\n",
    "* Built for the 21st century web estates\n",
    "* Schema-less\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"0.4\"><h3>0.4 Mainstream Nosql Databases</h3></a>\n",
    " \n",
    "There are total of four different types of nosql data models. In this tutorial, we will be introducing one mature database from each category. The selection of a particular database from each cateogry is inspired by the course 95-737 NoSQL Database Management. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Key-value: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Model : the fundamental data model of a key-value store is a collection of key-value pairs where the key is unique in the collection. A key can be an ID or a name or anything you want to use as an identifier. The value can be anything from strings, lists, hashes, to sets. This type of database typically do not know or care what is stored in the value and the contents are often represented as blobs giving you no visibility into its actual contents. This makes the functionality of these databases fairly limited, especially with queries. \n",
    "* Sample Database: Redis\n",
    "* strength: rich data structures, highly performant\n",
    "* weakness: don't support nested key-value pairs, costly to store huge datasets\n",
    "* common usage: caching users, timeline and tweets (Twitter), storing graph of who’s following whom (Pinterest)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Document:\n",
    "* Data Model: documents are the main concept in document databases. The database stores and retrieves documents, which can be XML, JSON, BSON, and so on. These documents are self-describing, hierarchical tree data structures which can consist of maps, collections, and scalar values. Document databases can store documents in the value part of the key-value store; think about document databases as key-value stores where the value is examinable.\n",
    "* Sample Database: MongoDB\n",
    "* Strength: very flexible to query by value\n",
    "* Weakness: express highly complex relationship, faceted search (depends on model design), and transactions over multiple documents\n",
    "* Common usage: producet catalogue, inventory management \n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Column Family: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Model: in column-family databases, each row consists of a collection of columns. A collection of similar rows then makes up a column family. In a relational databases, this would be equivalent to a collection of rows making up a table. The main difference is that in a column-family database, rows do not have to contain the same columns. De-normalizeid is usually a better solution and the design is centered around query patterns.\n",
    "* Sample Database: Cassandra\n",
    "* Strength: processing enormous amounts of mostly non-relational data, highly fault tolerant\n",
    "* Weakness: Only allow to query by primary key\n",
    "* Common usage: a web log analytics data warehouse and sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Graph: \n",
    "* Data Model: in graph databases, a graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and relationships (edges). This type of database is designed to capture complex, dynamic relationships in highly connected data.\n",
    "* Sample Database: Neo4j\n",
    "* Strength: querying deeply connected data that has many relationships expressed with complex joins\n",
    "* Weakness: does not support sharding in which each node contains only a portion of the total data\n",
    "* Common usage: social network\n"

    "2. After you have the database start and running, you can begin to think about how python can interact with this remote database. In fact, it's prettry easy. All information you need are the endpoint information and Redis password. The endpoint is a URL that consists of host and port in such format **host:post**, which you will be asked to fill in these numbers to the python code connecting to the cloud database.\n",

    "Curious why username appear both in two tables? Here I only give the example of Userline. But in fact Timeline and Userline tables can both be the result of denormalization. Timeline keeps track of people who are going to receive a user’s tweets, the time when the post was created and the tweetID. Userline keeps track of people who posted a tweet, the time of tweet posted and tweetID. By having denormalized tables stored in the database, a lot of queries involved join operations can be saved to enhance overall read performance. For example, in the case of a timeline, we don’t have to join tweets with the followers table to find out where a tweet should display, more specifically, who is going to see the tweet. But in fact, the table can be even more demoralized. By that I mean to directly copy the body of the tweet into both userline and timeline table. This will allow us to get everything we need in one table. \n"

    "At our first sight, we can spot two obvious clusters and many individual nodes. When your hover the mouse over a certain node, we will see the name and the screen_name of the node appear. This is because nodes can contain key-value pairs known as properties in neo4j. The left center node is **Trump** and the right center node is **realDonaldTrump**. This is a directed graph. The outer nodes that **Trump** and **RealDonaldTrump** are pointing to are the people they have followed. For further improvement on the graph, we can consider to add weights to the relationships or nodes when relavant data is available. Also, when you look closely, there are actually some nodes pointed (followed) both by both **Trump** and **RealDonaldTrump**. "
