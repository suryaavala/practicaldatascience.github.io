    "# Introduction to Frequent Pattern Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern mining is an important subfield for data mining and has been applied on a variety of applications. The intuition behind pattern mining is to discover interesting or useful patterns using pattern mining algorithms. Pattern mining algorithms can be applied on various types of data to discover various types of pattern such as direct/indirect associations and subgraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be focusing on the problem of mining frequent patterns. And we will be implementing one of the most popular algorithms for finding frequent patterns, the Apriori algorithm. This algorithm is first designed to discover common patterns of transactions made by customer in stores. One famous example is the Walmart's beer and diaper parable. Through mining hundreds of millions transaction records, Walmart surprisingly discovered that young American male who buy diapers tends to buy beer as well. The two products seem unrelated at all. One possible reason is that raising kids can be very stressful so dads decide to buy beer to relax. The sales of beer increased significantly after the beer is repositioned next to the diapers. Although this story is very likely an urban legend, the significant impact of the Apriori algorithm has on mining frequent patterns is undeniable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will introduce the Apriori algorithm and walk you through the implementation of it step by step. On top of that, we will also be optimizing the algorithm to make if more computationally efficient.\n"

    "# Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the Apriori algorithm is a popular data mining algorithm for mining frequent datasets and association rules. It is commonly applied on large transaction databases such as customer transactions for market basket analysis and healthcare databases for adverse drug detection reactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into how the algorithm works, we will first introduce two important measures that are used in the Apriori algorithm, support and confidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support\n",
    "The support of an itemset denotes the popularity of the itemset and is calculated by the proportion of the transactions in which the itemset X appears. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence\n",
    "The confidence calculates the likelihood of itemset Y being purchased when itemset X is being purchased. For example, if the association rule {'A', 'B'} ==> {'C', 'D'} has a 0.8 confidence interval, it means that 80% of the transactions that contains items A and B will also contain items C and D. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Used\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm utilizes two important properties to reduce search space. The first property is called the anti-monotonicity property. The idea is very simple. If there are two itemsets X and Y and X is a subset of Y. Then the support of Y must be less than or equal to the support of X. In other words, the number of transactions that contain Y must not be greater than the number of transactions that contain X. The second property shares a similar idea. For any infrequent itemset, all of its supersets will be infrequent as well. \n",

    "Although the Apriori algorithm is easy to implement and understand, it could take up a huge amount of time to compute as the data scales up. The reason is that Apriori generates all possible candidates and require multiple scans through the transaction list in order to determine if the candidates meet the minimum support threshold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can significantly decrease the number of scans required and improve the runtime efficiency using the following trick. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first scan all transactions to generate L1, which contains the items, their support count, and the transaction IDs that they take place. We will use L1 to help generate L2, L2 to help generate L3,…, just like what we did in the original Apriori algorithm. However, unlike scanning through all the transaction list over again and again, we only need to scan through the transactions that the item with the min support count in the n-itemset took place. For example, let (x,y) be one of the 2-itemset of C2 and x has a lower support count than y. Then we only need to scan through the transactions with ID related with x. Since we need to have both x and y in the transaction, this is simply sufficient for us to determine the correct support count with the least number of scans. By doing so, the number of scans through the transaction list can be greatly decreased.\n",
