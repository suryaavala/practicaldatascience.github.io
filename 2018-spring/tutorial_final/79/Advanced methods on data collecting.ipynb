    "# Introduction\n",
    " For most of the cases, your data sources (or the website) wil provide an API for you to crawl data under their constraints. But somtimes, you are not provided with a good API, or you are not provided with any of API, for example a VR web chat room or a map related web application, you will need to find your own way to crawl the data. In this tuotrial I will discuss some advanced method to crawl data under the circumstances I mentioned above.\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Background\n",
    "  First of all, we need to know that most of the mordern web applciations or websites are using RESTful to communicate with the background. And the one of the key points of the RESTful is stateless. That means if we can feed the proper payload into those APIs, we can get the data we need. Because the RESTful does not track what you have done before you sending the requests. Thus, if we can figure out the RESTful APIs and their payload requirements behind the screen, the rest are all about calling those APIs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ## Tools\n",
    "  The tool we used is really handy, you don't actually need to install it. Most of the modern broswers, like chrome, firefox or Safari, come with a inspection tool. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Here's what it looks like in chrome when open google.com\n",
    "  ![google.com](chrome.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  For those who usually do many web projects, they may be very familiar with this tool.For those who do not, I'm going to brefily introduce it. The inspection tool can be accessed by right clik any part of you web page and select inspect. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  There are three features you need to care about:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### Elements: \n",
    "  You can view the entire html structure of a web page under this tag. It will highlight the rendered html element when you mouse is on the corresponding html section.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### Console:\n",
    "  Everything that written by console.log() and exectuion errors in Javascript can be viewed under this tag\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### Network: \n",
    "  The core feature which this tutorial relies on. It will show all the traffic between your broswer and the backend server, including file transmitting and API calls.\n",

    "## Let's begin\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In this tutorial, we will use the livemap at [waze.com](https://www.waze.com/livemap) for example. \n",
    "  >Waze is the world's largest community-based traffic and navigation app. Join other drivers in your area who share real-time traffic and road info, saving everyone time and gas money on their daily commute.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ###### (This webapp is now providing data api to developers, but we can still use it as an example in this tutorial)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Navigate yourselves to a city that you are familiar with, for example New York. Then open your inspction tool and select Network section. Limit the results by clicking XHR, so we will see only the results of RESTful calls.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ![XHR](XHR.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Wait for a few seconds, and you will see something is popping up.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Congratulation, you find the secret of the waze app. The treasure is hiding behind https://www.waze.com/rtserver/web/TGeoRSS (The api endpoint)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For the next step, you need figure out what do those elements in the parameters and header mean. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a powerful tool to help you to figure out what are they, since there is not such tool.\n",
    "  But thanks to the RESTful style, most of the parameters are readable. Let's go through these parameters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ![parameters](parameters.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "  As you navigate through the map, you will find that top,bottom,left and right in the parameters are changing frequently. So these four parameters are the geo location that indicating where you are looking at. When you run follwoing codes, you will see that the respond comes with the following parts:\n",
    "  ###### alerts\n",
    "  ###### endTime\n",
    "  ###### startTime\n",
    "  ###### jams\n",
    "  ###### users\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Thus, the meaning of parameters ma,mj and mu are very obvious, they are the maxuim numbers of alerts, jams, and users that will be returned.\n",
    "  Finally, what does \"_\" mean in the parameter? As the responds keep poppin up, we can see that the \"_\" parameter is incrementing by one. So this parameter may be something that relates to the time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Now, it's your time to practice. Try modify or remove some of the parameters and see what is happening. You will find that the _ parameters is not necessary."

Inorder to work around this, we need to prevent like a broswer.Luckily the requests module in python provides a way that allow us the behave like a web broswer. This is called sessions.\n",
    ">The Session object allows you to persist certain parameters across requests. It also persists cookies across all requests made from the Session instance, and will use urllib3's connection pooling  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to be acting like a broswer, you need to specify the user-agent in the request header. This section will tell the server what broswer your are using. If you do not tell the server such information, the server will think you are not using any broswer, thus it will ban your request according to their policy.  \n",

    "\n",
    "![login](login.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the screenshoot, the broswer first call a GET to www.waze.com/login/get before it starts loading the actual data. And in the respond header, we can see a Set-cookie section.  \n",
    "The process here is clearer. The broswer will first call the /login/get to set the cookies before retriving data. The following data forge this call and store the cookies in the session object."
