    "Seaborn is a graph visualization library for python. It is based on matplotlib, but offers a highly interactive interface which enables users to make creative and attractive statistical plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare to matplotlib, Seaborn modules provide more themes style and advanced interfaces to make our graphs fancier. Moreover, the code to use Seaborn is concise and elegant. It is also highly compatible with numpy, pandas and scipy. \n",
    "Specifically, Seaborn provides advanced API encapsulation based on matplotlib to make graphs easily. In most cases, Seaborn would be enough for users' needs, but matplotlib can make more complexed graphs. Therefore, we should regard Seaborn as a easier supplement for matplotlib rather than a substitute.\n"

    "Drawing attractive figures is important. When making figures for yourself, as you explore a dataset, it’s nice to have plots that are pleasant to look at. Visualizations are also central to communicating quantitative insights to an audience, and in that setting it’s even more necessary to have figures that catch the attention and draw a viewer in.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making graphs, it is important for graphs to have a pleasant look. Use appropriate theme and style can also contribute to the communication with audience. Seaborn allows users to set themes with pleasant look easily by providing style and palette APIs. You can view the whole list of available APIs [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), and we will also use some of them in this tutorial."
