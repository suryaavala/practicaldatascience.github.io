All assignments for the class will be listed here.  The assignments will conist of:

- Five homework assignments, each with 2-3 programming prblems.
- A midterm "tutorial" assignment where you will write up a short tutorial on a data science subject.
- A final project, done in groups, on a data science problem of your choosing.

All assignments are due at 11:59pm ET (midnight) on the due date, and will be released by this same time on the release date.  

## Assigment dates (tenative)

## Homeworks

Homeworks are distributed as Jupyter notebooks, submitted for autograding via [Autolab](http://autolab.andrew.cmu.edu).  The autograders for the homeworks will be live within *48 hours* of the homework release date, or the due date will be shifted back accordingly.

**Late days**: Each student is permitted 5 late days they may use over the course of the semester, using no more than 2 late days on each assignment.  **After the two late days on each assignment, or after you have used the five late days, you will receive zero credit for the assignment**.  Late days may **only** be used for the homework assignments, not for the tutorial or final project. 


## Tutorial
In lieu of a midterm exam, students will write a tutorial on a data science topic of their choosing.  More information will be posted here when the assignment is released.  Again, **no late days are permitted** on the tutorial, and failure to submit by the deadline will result in zero points.


## Final project
The final project of the course will consist of a large data science project done in teams of 2-3 people (single person or four person teams will be considered on an individual basis).  The final report for this project will be a Jupyter notebook detailing the data collection, analysis, and results.  In addition to the report, teams will also prepare a short (2 minute) video for showing during a final project video session, **taking place during the final exam time**.  More information and dates will be available when the assignment is released.  Again, **no late days are permitted** on the final project, and failure to submit by the deadline will result in zero points.
