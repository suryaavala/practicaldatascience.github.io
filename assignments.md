All assignments for the class will be listed here.

- Five homework assignments, each with 2-3 programming problems.
- A midterm "tutorial" assignment where you will write up a short tutorial on a data science subject.
- A final project, done in groups, on a data science problem of your choosing.

All assignments will be released by 11:59 PM ET on the release date, and are due at 11:59pm ET (midnight) on the due date.

## Assignment dates

We may occasionally modify assignment dates and scopes. If we do that, there will be an announcement here and in-class.

| | Release date | Due date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Homework 1]() ([instructions]() | 1/24 | 2/7 |
| [Homework 2]() | 2/7 | 2/21 |
| [Homework 3]() | 2/21 | 3/7 |
| [Tutorial]() | 2/21 | 2/28 ([proposal]()), 3/30 |
| [Homework 4](), [Contest Data]() | 3/28 | 4/11 |
| [Homework 5](), [Data]() | 4/18 | 5/2 |
| [Final project]() | 3/7 | 3/26 ([proposal]()), 5/9 (video), 5/11 (report)|

## Homeworks

Homeworks are distributed as Jupyter notebooks, submitted for auto-grading via [Diderot](http://diderot.one/).

**Late days**: Each student is permitted 5 late days they may use over the course of the semester, using no more than 2 late days on each assignment.  **After the two late days on each assignment, or after you have used the five late days, you will receive zero credit for the assignment**.  Late days may **only** be used for the homework assignments, not for the tutorial or final project.

**Grace period**: Assignments must be submitted by 11:59pm on the due date, according to the server timestamp. There is no grace period given for assignments submitted late. Complete your work and submit early!

**Server error**: If there is an error with the server, you may send your assignment to [Gaurav Manek](mailto:gmanek@cs.cmu.edu?subject=pds-submit) with the subject line `pds-submit`. We will compare the email and the server submission timestamps and grade the latest version before the timestamp.

## Tutorial

In lieu of a midterm exam, students will write a tutorial on a data science topic of their choosing.  More information will be posted here when the assignment is released.  Again, **no late days are permitted** on the tutorial, and failure to submit by the deadline will result in zero points.

## Final project

The final project of the course will consist of a large data science project done in teams of 2-3 people (single person or four person teams will be considered on an individual basis).  The final report for this project will be a Jupyter notebook detailing the data collection, analysis, and results.  In addition to the report, teams will also prepare a short (2 minute) video for showing during a final project video session, **taking place during the final exam time**.  More information and dates will be available when the assignment is released.  Again, **no late days are permitted** on the final project, and failure to submit by the deadline will result in zero points.
