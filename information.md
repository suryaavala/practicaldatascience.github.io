### Prequisites

Programming experience is necessary for the course (assignments are in Python). For undegraduates, either 15-112 or 15-122 is required.

Experience with linear algebra, probability, and statistics is recommended, but not strictly required (courses like 21-240/241/242 for linear algebra or 36-201 for probability/statistics are more than sufficient). Students concerned about whether they have a proper background should contact the course instructors to discuss.
