This course is offered as `15-388 A` (a 9-unit course for undergraduates with live lectures), and `15-688 A/B` (a 12-unit course for masters with choice between live lectures (section A) and no meetings (section B)).

Both courses have the same lectures, but the latter will have additional advanced problems in their assignments.

### Meeting

This course meets every Monday and Wednesday 3:00pm--4:20pm in [Doherty Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/CdzUdGEaFPJ8frwh9) 2210.

### Prerequisites

Programming experience is necessary for the course, all assignments are in Python. For undergraduates, either 15-112 or 15-122 is required.

Experience with linear algebra, probability, and statistics is recommended, but not strictly required (courses like 21-240/241/242 for linear algebra or 36-201 for probability/statistics are more than sufficient). Students concerned about whether they have a proper background should contact the course instructors to discuss.

### Grading

- 50% homework
- 15% tutorial
- 25% final project
- 10% class participation

#### Participation

If you are in section A, then your participation grade comes from your participation in polls administered during class. Speaking up during class and participating in the class forums may help your grade.

If you are in section B, then a short quiz after most lectures will be used. Participating in the class forums may also help your grade.

For all students,
