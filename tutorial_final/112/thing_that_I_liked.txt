The tutorial is an interesting assignment that provides a great deal of flexibility.  It's a breath of fresh air to be able to write detailed explanations of code rather than simply throw together whatever passes an autograder.  While I don't believe it qualifies as a suitable exam replacement, as it allows the student to talk about whatever they know best and doesn't test them on the stuff they know worst, it is a very enjoyable assignment that allows me to express myself.   It also allowed me to teach myself more about an algorithm that I was already very interested in.
