    "## Tutorial on the Elasticsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine: [**Elasticsearch**](https://www.elastic.co/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticsearch is built over on [Apache Lucene™](http://lucene.apache.org/), a popular Java serach engine library and provides a JSON based REST API to refer to Lucene features. Elasticsearch allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time (just a slight latency for a new docuement to be searchable). It is generally used by the applications which need complex search features and requirements. Here is several examples about its usage: \n",
    "* **Wikipedia** uses Elasticsearch to provide full-text search with highlighted search snippets, and search-as-you-type and did-you-mean suggestions.\n",
    "* **The Guardian** uses Elasticsearch to combine visitor logs with social -network data to provide real-time feedback to its editors about the public’s response to new articles.\n",
    "* **Stack Overflow** combines full-text search with geolocation queries and uses more-like-this to find related questions and answers.\n",
    "* **GitHub** uses Elasticsearch to query 130 billion lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Elasticsearch terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticsearch uses its own terms, which in some cases is different from typical database systems. \n",
    "Here are some common terms we may meet along this tutorial:\n",
    "* **Node**: A node is a single running Elasticsearch instance that is part of your cluster, stores your data, and participates in the cluster’s indexing and search capabilities. \n",
    "* **Cluster**: A cluster is a collection of one or more nodes (servers) that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes.\n",
    "* **Document**: A document is a basic unit of information stored in Elasticsearch. \n",
    "* **Index**: An index is a collection of documents that have somewhat similar characteristics. We can define as many indexes as we want in a single cluster. You can think it as a table in the traditional relational database.\n",
    "* **Shards & Replicas**: Since the data stored in each node are possible to exceed the hardware limits, Elasticsearch provides to subdivide the index into multiple pieces other nodes called shards. each shards is stored in the nodes of the cluster. Also, Elasticsearch could replic each shard in case some nodes fails. By default, each index in Elasticsearch is allocated 5 primary shards and 1 replica.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why choose Elasticsearch?\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Fast search responses\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Compared to the tradition relational database, Elasticsearch will create an inverted index for the provided document, which helps in making searches faster. The inverted index is a data structure, which is designed to allow very fast full-text searches. An inverted index consists of a list of all the unique words that appear in any document, and for each word, a list of the documents in which it appears. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, let’s say we have two documents, each with a content field containing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\n",
    "        b. Quick brown foxes leap over lazy dogs in summer\n",
    "        \n",
    "   In the Elasticsearch, These two docuements will be stored in the structures like this. \n",
    "   With the inverted index, Elasticsearch is able to searches an index, instead of searching the text directly. \n",
    "   \n",
    "| Term    | Doc_1 | Doc_2 |\n",
    "| :------ |:------|:------|\n",
    "| brown   |   X   |  X    |\n",
    "| dog     |   X   |  X    |\n",
    "| fox     |   X   |  X    |\n",
    "| in      |       |  X    |\n",
    "| jump    |   X   |  X    |\n",
    "| lazy    |   X   |  X    |\n",
    "| over    |   X   |  X    |\n",
    "| quick   |   X   |  X    |\n",
    "| summer  |       |  X    |\n",
    "| the     |   X   |  X    |\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Easy to scale\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another reason is because Elasticsearch is also a distributed storage system. It has the ability to extend resources and balance the loading between the nodes in a cluster. It also replicates the data automatically to prevent data loss in case of server node failure. It has capacity to run on hundreds of server and handle petabytes of documents\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Moreover, the cluster is very easy to build. Just bring up multiple Elasticsearch nodes on the same network and assign the cluster name to them. Many things will be done automatically by Elasticsearch including discovery and master selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Excellent Query DSL\n",
    "\n",
    "    Elasticsearch has a powerful JSON-based DSL (domain specific language), which allows development teams the ability to construct complex queries and fine tune them to receive the most precise results from a search. We will use Query DSL in the later example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Using RESTful API and JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "    Everything in Elasticsearch can be controlled via RESTful API - from creating indexes to changing the number of replicas per index, all can be done on the go using simple RESTful API calls. Queries and responses are always in JSON format , which is both machine and human readable. For the developer, It is very convenient to manipulate the docuements with these API calls. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* #### Variety of useful Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "    Elasticsearch provides some default functionality, such as tokenizer, analyzer. But it also allow Plugins to be installed to enhance the basic Elasticsearch functionality. The plugins are range from adding custom mapping types, custom analyzers (in a more built in fashion), custom script engines, custom discovery and more. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Building a simple Yelp Search Engine using Elasticsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, to have a better understanding of Elasticsearch, let's start building a simple Yelp search engine of the restaurants near Carnegie Mellon University. This engine will provide the functionality as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. If user searches restaurant name, it returns a list of this restaurant.\n",
    "    b. If user searches food name, it returns all the restaurants which sell this food.\n",
    "    c. Sort the result by the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Download and run the Elasticsearch\n",
    "1. Elasticsearch is built using Java, and requires at least Java 8 in order to run.\n",
    "2. Download Elasticsearch from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch.\n",
    "3. Run `bin/elasticsearch` (or `bin\\elasticsearch.bat` on Windows). \n",
    "\n",
    "    The Elasticsearch will default run on http://localhost:9200/ with 1GB JVM heap size. You can configure the basic setting through `config/elasticsearch.yml` and the JVM setting through `config/jvm.options`\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Then, open a terminal and run ```curl http://localhost:9200/```(or on the other port you specify) to check if the Elasticsearch is started. \n",
    "\n",
    "    You should get the response like this:\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"name\" : \"node-1\",      // node name\n",
    "      \"cluster_name\" : \"15-688-tutorial\",      // cluster name\n",

    "      },\n",
    "      \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2. Download the Python Elasticsearch Client\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use Python Elasticsearch Client [*elasticsearch-py*](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py) to call the interfaces in the Elasticsearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the elasticsearch-py package with pip:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install elasticsearch\n",
    "```\n",
    "After the installation, we can connect to the Elasticsearch in Python."
