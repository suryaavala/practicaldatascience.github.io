    "In 2015, Facebook's Chat API, which allowed websites and apps to access the Facebook Messenger tool and analyze messenger data, was deprecated because app developers had access to user's friends' information and this raised concerns about people's privacy. Currently, Facebook Developer Toolkit mainly consists of the Ads API, the Graph API, and the Facebook SDK, but none of these allow us to access data from Facebook Messenger. Therefore, this tutorial will demonstrate how to extract information from your messages using Selenium Webdriver to login to your account and BeautifulSoup to parse each conversation to gather the necessary information. More specifically, I will analyze for each person you have a chat history with the number of messages you send vs. they send, the number of total characters that you've sent vs. they've sent, and the number of times you initiatied the conversation vs. they did and then calculate an overall rating for the contribution you have vs. they have in your conversation with them, since I thought these statistics would be interesting for people who use Facebook. However, this tutorial can serve a more general purpose on how to webscrape your Facebook Messenger to analyze any data that you are interested in."

    "Now that you've installed the libraries, the first step is to initialize the webdriver to login to your Facebook account. First you must input your username and password, and then open up the webdriver to https://www.facebook.com/. It finds the 'email' and 'password' field on the webpage and sends the previously inputted account information for the webdriver to type in and click on the 'Log in' button automatically. A cool aspect about the webdriver is that you can see it open up a new browser to the Facebook webpage and then type in your account information. Therefore, you can control the webdriver through your code but also manually by clicking and typing as you would in a normal browser. This is a useful tool because you have the power to access the web developer tools in chrome to access the html code and find certain elements on the page you are currently viewing, which will be useful when we use BeautifulSoup to parse the page. However, a downside to using this webdriver is that you need to wait for the website to load before actually moving on, which is why I installed the time package so the program can wait. Otherwise, the program will return an error because certain elements will not be found since the webpage was not fully loaded yet."

If you scroll down the list of conversations far enough, it loads more conversations, which means that not all conversations can be seen when the page is first loaded. Webdrivers have a built in scroll function, but in the Facebook website there are multiple scroll bars, so the built in scroll function does not work. Therefore, we must use another method to simulate scrolling. When you scroll, you can briefly see a 'Show Older' button before more conversations automatically load in, so if you search for the element 'Show Older' and tell the driver to click on it, it simulates scrolling down the conversation panel to load more conversations. For the purposes of this tutorial, I limited the amount of times it clicks on 'Show Older' to five times. It is also important to note that you should use time.sleep so the page has time to load the conversations before trying to click on 'Show Older' again because an error would occur."

If a message was sent in the past week, it shows up in a format like \"Monday 10:20am\". If a message was sent within a month, it shows up in the format as \"March 22nd, 11:16pm\". Any other messages are shown as \"September 13, 2015 3:18 am\". Therefore, we need to take each message date and format it according to when the message was sent.

I thought an overall rating on how much each person contributes to a conversation would be interesting to see rather than just viewing a bunch of numbers, so I created a criteria in that the number of first messages sent contributes 30%, number of messages sent contributes 30%, and the total number of characters sent contributes 40% for the overall rating. I chose this criteria because I thought the number of characters sent is the greatest measurement of someone's participation in a conversation, although the others are also important. These percentages are very subjective and can be modified to your own criteria. I then calculate the ratio of each first messages sent, ratio of total number of messages sent, and ratio of number of characters sent by dividing by the total.

    "Now that we've defined all the functions to parse each of our conversations, all we have to do now is to iterate through each of the conversations and call the required functions. I've limited it to the first 15 conversations to minimize program run time, but you can parse through more conversations by changing the range in the for loop. We've created a function to extract all the links to each conversation, and then we iterate through each one by using a new function of Selenium Webdriver which is called find_element_by_xpath, which allows us to give it a html tag path, and it will find the element in the given page and click on it. Each conversation begins with the same tag < a class = \"_1ht5 _2il3 _5l-3 _3itx\" > but a different data-href attribute which we pass in from our extracted links list. We then scroll through the conversation to present older messages. We extract the data, and the analyze it to get the number of messages sent and the number of initial messages sent. We finally call the rate function to provide an overall rating to our results for this conversation."
