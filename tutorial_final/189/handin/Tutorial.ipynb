    "\n",
    "Let’s say pattern set is {his, he, hers, she}, and text is “hershershershers”, then we use Aho–Corasick algorithm to get positions of patterns occurring at text, i.g.:\n",

For example, occurrence frequency of a specific pattern in corpus can be a feature in machine learning algorithm, and we count occurrence by pattern matching. On the other side, we can filter out patterns by searching patterns algorithm.\n",

    "AC algorithm is used to match multiple patterns in text. Once we finished pre-processing, we can use O(n) time to find all matches in text, n is the length of text. In this tutorial, I use double array trie to represent goto function and failure function, which saves a lot of memory."
