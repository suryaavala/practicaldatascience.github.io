Hi,

I have attached multiple ipython notebooks to mimimize risk of it not rendering the plots. 

One version is nbviewer compatible.
One version has static images of the plots.

As a last resort, I have also added the web archaive file of the tutorial. (works best with safari).

Hope you enjoy it.
