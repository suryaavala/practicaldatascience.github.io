    "# Introduction to Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn about the basics of Tensorflow and how it helps to implement simple deep learning architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Tensorflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow is a library which was developed by the Google Brain team in November, 2015. It is gaining popularity as a library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. The graph structure has been designed such that the nodes represent mathematical operations and the edges represent tensors. Tensors are nothing but n-dimensional arrays. The main reason for tensorflow's popularity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Adaptability in a variety of programming languages e.g. Octave, C++, Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) It is an open-source library.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It provides GPU support to allow for complex calculations on most kinds of computing devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Great network architecture visualization using Tensorboard\n",
    "\n",
    "4) It has been made by Google and is becoming a standard across various organizations!\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to install Tensorflow. The first is through the native pip method. The other is through Anaconda. For obvious purposes, we will install it on Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a conda environment named tensorflow by invoking the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        C:> conda create -n tensorflow pip python=3.5\n",
    "        \n",
    "2) Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        C:> activate tensorflow\n",
    "        (tensorflow)C:>  # Your prompt should change\n",
    "        \n",
    "3) Issue the appropriate command to install TensorFlow inside your conda environment. To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        (tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow #CPU support only\n",
    "        \n",
    "4) Additional steps - You might need to install other libraries also in the Tensorflow environment. For this open the conda prompt and issue the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        (tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow #CPU support only\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Validating Installation and First Program\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run our first tensorflow program. This will also help us to validate whether the library has been downloaded properly or not."

    "## Learning the basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before attempting to code a complex neural network, it would be better if we could could learn the basic syntax and programming by attempting a simple linear regressional model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before programming, we will discuss some basics. There are basically three types of data in Tensorflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Constants - These are constant values which cannot be changed after they are initialized. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Variables - Variables are basically values which can be changed after initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Placeholders - A placeholder is simply a variable that we will assign data to at a later date. It allows us to create our operations and build our computation graph, without needing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in-built iterative functions which allow for regression and updating the weights in Tensorflow. We will use the GradientDescentOptimizer function to solve a simple linear regression to get started. Please read comments below to understand the code."

The Democrats had two candidates and the Republicans had 17.\n",

    "We will be training a neural network such that if we know the outcome of the primary elections in 80% of the counties, will we be able to predict the winner for the other  states? A good way to frame the question will be to see if demographics has some underlying criteria which helps in determining the winner of the elections. For this, we first need to upload and perform data cleaning on the dataset.\n"

    "## Neural Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we are ready to implement our neural network architecture. A neural network is used to train data in a non-linear way. Usually, computer code works in a linear and logical manner. Thus, it becomes challenging to train the machine to interpret data in a non-linear way. This where neural networks come to the rescue. As can be seen in the image below, the hidden layer is linear function of your inputs, which are then made to behave non-linearly using activation functions, such as sigmoid, softmax and ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "These networks are then trained iteratively with each training datapoint using backpropagation, which updates the weights (using gradient descent). The number of hidden layers and the number of hidden units in each layer form your hyperparameters."

    "It is working! We were able to train a neural network which is predicting primary results with 73% accuracy. It is not much, however, there is scope for improvement. We can continue to tweak hyperparameters to increase the accuracy. This is just a small example to show how powerful Tensorflow is. It takes care of weight updates in single steps and offers GPU support to allow fitting of complex network architecture. You are free to use the dataset and keep on increasing the accuracy.\n",

    "## Bonus: Introduction to Tensorboard\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great things about Tensorflow is that it allows great visualization of your computational models. Usually, when implementing deep learning architectures, it is easy to lose track of the hidden layers and units. The visualization is done in an environment called Tensorboard. For that reason, we will just show, how the graph flows can be visualized. Interestingly, you can tweak tensorflow and visualize Tensorboard graphs interactively in a Python Notebook, without needing a new window. The code has been taken from [1].\n",

    "The code has not been claimed to be written by me. I am merely using it for educational purposes. I have commented it, in case, you don't want to use it."
