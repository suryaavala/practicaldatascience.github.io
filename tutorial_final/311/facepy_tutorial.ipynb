    "Facebook is one of the most popular and large-scale social network in the world. It contains a huge amount of data for social network analysis. Therefore, it would be helpful to know how to access those data if you want to study about network of human or even trends around the globe. The tutorial will introduce how to collect data from Facebook for further analysis. This includes  introduction of [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) with basic web scraping techniques and usage of [Facepy](https://facepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a python package which make interactaction with Facebook API much easier.
