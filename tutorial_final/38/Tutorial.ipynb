    "## Apache Spark\n",
    "Due to the invention of the internet and the increasing 3V (volume, variety, and velocity) of data, data scientists and engineers nowadays need to deal with terabytes of data in a more distributed way to facilitate the speed of the data science pipeline. In this tutorial, I'm going to introduce Apache Spark, an open-source cluster-computing framework, and its application in big data processing as well as exploratory data analysis. Spark provides APIs for several high-level programming languages including Python and Scala so that the programmers could easily develop MapReduce data processing programs at their convenience. The major advantage of Spark over tranditional MapReduce is that it supports in-memory computing, which could significantly improve the runtime performance. Spark also provides advanced libraries such as Spark MLlib and GraphX for distributed machine learning and graph processing on top of Apache Spark. After introducing the basics of Spark, I'll briefly introduce the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling functionality in PySpark MLlib in the last section of this tutorial."
