    "# Introduction\n",
    "A lot of data can come in the form of not just individual objects with particular characteristics, but also objects that can be related to each other in certain ways. Examples of this can include say, friends on a social network, or citations in academic papers. This is somewhat similar to relational databases, but the relations in this case are all amongst discrete actors that have similar “status” rather than rows that can differ. \n",

    "\n",
    "The usefulness of networks is that we can use them to examine relations between actors, and on a greater scale, relations within a given group of actors, rather than just individual actors. This then allows us to help determine certain facts and ideas about the group. For example, for a network of people, it may indicate if there are semi distinct cliques, or if there is a “leader” amongst all the other actors. These then allow us to analyze the overarching structures of real world groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case rather than examining theoretical or arbitrary networks, we can analyze ones that occur in the real world, such as those within social media, or other networks where there are actors that can have links, and delivering some higher level data that might lend insight into the nature of the network and potentially its relation to other networks. One of the big practical differences is that this allows us to reduce network information into quantifiable and qualitative data that might be easier to draw conclusions from than the raw network. This applied approach also means that certain characteristics of a network can be analyzed on a sliding scale, rather than as a hard binary as can be the case in graph theory"

    "# Network Basics\n",
    "In a network there is a set of nodes, which represent the actors and a set of links that can go between two nodes, which represent relations. If that sounds familiar, it’s because networks are effectively equivalent to graphs, with some modified terminology of \n",
    "* Node - Vertex\n",
    "* Link - Edge\n",
    "Otherwise they are conceptually the same. Networks can also be undirected or directed, with friendships being an example of the latter and say, monetary transactions between people being an example of the latter. They can also have weighted edges, which should be some quantity that would indicate something about the link in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Paths\n",
    "A path is basically a sequence of nodes where each node has a link to the next and previous nodes. Usually these paths are ways for us to get from a particular starting node to a particular ending node by “walking” along the links. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example With ORA\n",
    "First, you can download ORA for windows at the following link:\n",
    "http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/download.php\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the network indicated in the picture indicating a group of classmates and where each link represents a certain number of times that the source node has helped the destination node with homework that year:\n",
    "<img src=\"nBasics.png\" width=300px>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that it is asymmetric, because the edges are all directed and some are unidirectional. Further, we can see that there is a path between say, Bob and Sam that goes Bob-Tim-Sarah-Sam\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to represent this network is simply providing a list of nodes and a list of edges, potentially with weights in a deliniated text csv file as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges:\n",
    "```\n",
    "From,To,Weight\n",
    "Bob,Tim,1\n",
    "Jane,Tim,2\n",
    "Sarah,Sam,3\n",
    "Sarah,Alice,4\n",
    "Tim,Sarah,1\n",
    "Sarah,Tim,1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the CSV file, you can just copy the above text into a file labelled \"filename.csv\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then start up ORA. Click the magic wand in the corner to import data and select \"Table of network links\" under \"Import Excel or Text Delimited Files\"\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-27 at 4.11.04 PM.png\">\n",
    "Hit next twice and then select the .csv file containing the above edges, and select both FROM and TO columns to contain node names, and have the nodeset class be \"Agent\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, hit the \"new\" button at the bottom and set the source, target, and link weight to From, To and Weight, respectively as such:\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-27 at 4.11.35 PM.png\">\n",

    "# Node Centrality\n",
    "In examining nodes, we also are interested in the overall “importance” of a given node. If the network represents people, does a given node correspond to a popular or unpopular person. If they were to say, espouse an idea, how quickly would it spread. More morbidly if we were to “remove” this person, what impact would it have? There is no objective way to consider the importance of a given actor, so there are multiple measures that can potentially inform it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these characteristics is centrality, which is a characteristic of a singular node that usually in some way indicates its “importance”. There are multiple kinds of centrality and here are a few basic types\n",
    "### In-degree centrality\n",
    "What is the degree of links coming in. This may indicate how many of a certain relation points inward toward the node. So for example, The in-degree centrality of Bob in the example network is 0 because the node has no outgoing links.\n",
    "### Out-degree centrality\n",
    "What is the degree of outgoing links. This may indicate how many of a certain relation points inward toward the node. So for example, The (unscaled) out-degree centrality of Bob in the example network is 1 because the node has one outgoing link.\n",
    "### Total-degree\n",
    "This is a measure of the overall degree so it would be the sum of the in-degree and out-degree centrality.\n",
    "### Betweenness\n",
    "How many shortest paths between two nodes pass through this one? This one can indicate that a node may be an important link between two disparate groups or is in a potentially high traffic area (if the centrality is high). This can mean that say, the removal of nodes that have high betweenness causes the network to fracture more.\n",
    "### Eigenvector Centrality and PageRank Centrality\n",
    "These are two different measures but both, in different ways indicate a node’s connections to other nodes that are high in centrality, essentially indicating the importance of neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example in ORA\n",
    "If we take the meta network we imported in the last example, if we select \"Agent: size 6\" in the sidebar, indicating the nodeset, and then \"Editor\" on the top bar, which lets us see the actual nodes, we should get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-27 at 6.00.20 PM.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now it's just a list of the node names of the network that we imported. However, in ORA we can add more characteristics. We can add attributes that we can manually edit by selecting Attributes > Create New Attribute. However, for our purpouses, the more interesting ability is to create attribute measures, such as those above, which are calculated from the network structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, select \"Create New Attribute Measure\" from the Attributes menu\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-27 at 6.00.29 PM.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings up a window that prompts you for which networks you want to include in this measure, since a nodeset can correspond to multiple different netowrks. In this case we can just say \"Entire Meta-Network\" because we only have one. It then also prompts you to choose a node measure. Among the choices are those that we described above. For this example, say we choose betweenness (although you can play around with all the other measures too).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-27 at 6.12.14 PM.png\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new column with values for betweeness centrality. Now, remembering the definition given earlier, since all except Tim and Sarah are leaves, in that they represent dead ends, they have no betweeness, and Tim and Sarah, which are on the shortest paths from say, Bob to Sam, have higher and equal betweeness, in keeping with the definition. \n",

    "# Network Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "However, suppose we don't just care about individual nodes but we want more general metrics of the network. These will often be measures that are easy to calculate for a single node, but can also yield potentially useful information when calculated for the entire network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Density\n",
    "This is something that comes up in graph theory as well. it basically means that of all the potential links in the network, how many actually exist? A high density can mean that all the nodes have relations with almost all the other nodes in the graph, whereas a low density can indicate that nodes have relations with a select group but not necessarily with everyone else\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristic Path Length\n",
    "Of particular importance are the shortest paths between two nodes, which often represent the closest set of connections they have. In the case of networks, we would be interested in how long these shortest paths are. If we average the length of the shortest paths amongst all pairs of nodes (excluding ones where that is not applicable) what we get is called the characteristic path length, and it can indicate something about the relative “distance” of nodes. For example, in a network of airports and airplane traffic, a long characteristic path length could indicate that if you want to fly between two arbitrary cities, you should prepare for a lot of connecting flights. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reciprocity\n",
    "This is of importance in directed graphs. In effect, if node a has a link going to node b, how likely is it that there is a link in the opposite direction. In essence, how likely are links to be reciporcated?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example in ORA\n",
    "\n",
    "To view network characteristics, one thing we can do is to generate a report. A report is an external file generated by ORA that contains selected quantitative data about a given network. The way to do this is to select the meta-network in the sidebar and click \"Generate Reports.\"\n",

In this particular case we are selecting \"All measured by category\" but there are other reports that we can make use of as well. We then select \"Network Measures\" and then select the folder we want to save the report in\n",

    "# Visual Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered node-level measures and some network-level measures, but  Moreover, some means of analyzing networks are not necessarily qualitative. Often it can be useful to just look at the network visually. Some uses of these include being able to survey the whole network, and visually being able to identify trends. However, the layout, coloring and other choices in presentation can be changed to inform what kids of discoveries you are able to make.\n",

    "We can also color and size nodes by measures and also modify link appearance by link measures. To do this we can select Node Appearance of Link Appearance menus, which bring up different characteristics like size and color. We then choose to \"Set node ____ by attribute or measure\" for nodes, which brings up a window prompting us to choose which attribute/measure, or \"Set link ____ by link value\". For example, this is what happens when we set node size based on degree centrality and link color by link value.\n",
